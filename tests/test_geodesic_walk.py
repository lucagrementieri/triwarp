"""
Regression tests for ``triwarp.geodesic_walk`` against potpourri3d (CPU reference).

Two things are checked independently of the reference, because they are what "a geodesic" means: the
traced arc length equals the requested one (the direction's tangential magnitude), and every traced
point lies on the surface. Against potpourri3d the arc lengths agree exactly; the *endpoints* agree
only to a fraction of an edge length, because a path crossing a vertex has no unique straightest
continuation and the two libraries resolve that differently (see the module docstring).

    Class B: equal after a named transform -- flow both loops to the geodesic in their class.

    ``EdgeFlipGeodesicSolver.find_geodesic_loop`` shortens a loop *within its homotopy class*, so
    the length it converges to is a property of the class and not of the curve handed to it. Running
    it from the input loop and from the shortened one must therefore give the same number, and that
    is the whole correctness claim: shortening is allowed to move the curve anywhere in its class
    and nowhere else. Measured **bit-identical** on both generators of the fixture (relative
    difference 0.0), and the same on a 24x12 torus and on a genus-2 union.

    A length comparison alone could not carry this. A sweep that leaked out of its class would
    usually get *shorter*, so it would look like a better result; the invariant is what says no.

    The gap that remains is real and is not tested as an equality: this stays on the edge graph
    where the reference crosses face interiors, and the ratio to the geodesic length is between
    **1.066x** and **1.578x** across the three meshes above -- widest where the mesh is a regular
    grid whose rows are not geodesics, because a one-ring move cannot step the loop off a row
