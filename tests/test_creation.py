    Class A on the counts and Class B on the invariants -- and the four agree **exactly**.

    Stronger than the plan for this pairing predicted, which was a rigid-motion comparison after
    scaling: measured on all four, the vertex and face counts, the enclosed volume, the surface
    area *and* the bounding-box **extent** match to float32. The extent is asserted because volume
    and area are both invariant under a rotation and would not notice a differently oriented cone.

    Where the two do differ is *where the origin sits*, and only for one of the four: MeshLib's
    ``makeCylinder`` is **base-anchored** (z from 0 to the length) where triwarp's is centred on
    z = 0, while ``makeCone`` is base-anchored on **both** sides and the box and torus are centred
    on both. That is a convention rather than a disagreement, so it is pinned per primitive below
    rather than absorbed into a tolerance.

    Two more parameter conventions have to be crossed, both silent if got wrong. ``makeCube`` takes
    a ``size`` and a **base corner** rather than a centre, so a centred box needs
    ``base = -size / 2``; and ``makeCylinder`` / ``makeCone`` default to a radius of **0.1**, not 1,
    so a call that omits it builds something ten times too thin rather than failing.

    ``uv_sphere`` has its own test below rather than a row here, because it needs a parameter
    mapping first: at the same nominal resolution the two tessellate differently -- 450 vertices and
    896 faces against MeshLib's 258 and 512 at ``16 x 16`` -- and deriving the mapping is what that

    Four primitives against MeshLab's ``create_*`` generators, which agree exactly on the shape.

    a fresh set and the answer is read off ``current_mesh()``.

    Two of the four are the *same mesh*: ``create_cube`` and ``create_torus`` match triwarp's vertex
    set as a bijection (to 0 and 4.4e-07). The other two are the same mesh under a rotation about
    the axis -- MeshLab seats the icosahedron base and the cone seam at a different angle, so the
    vertex positions differ by up to 0.163 and 1.43 while every measure agrees -- and
    ``create_cone`` is additionally *centred* on the origin where triwarp's cone stands on ``z =
    0``, hence the ``h / 2`` translation. Those two are therefore compared through
    [`_sorted_edge_lengths`][tests.test_creation._sorted_edge_lengths], which is invariant to both,

    """
    Class A on the counts and the solid: a convex ring extrudes to the same mesh in all three.

    A convex ring is used deliberately rather than the L-shape the trimesh comparison below runs on.
    The cap admits only one triangulation up to a rotation of the fan there, so the *counts* are
    comparable exactly -- ``2 * (n - 2)`` cap triangles plus ``2 * n`` wall triangles, measured
    **64** vertices and **124** faces from all three on a 32-gon, watertight with chi = 2.

    The split between the two references is who triangulates the cap, and it decides how each one is
    handed the input:

    * **pyvista** ``extrude((0, 0, h), capping=True)`` takes a ``PolyData`` whose single polygon
      *cell* is the cap, so VTK triangulates on the way out and ``.triangulate()`` is required --
      without it the result carries polygons, not triangles, and the cell count is not comparable.
    * **open3d** ``extrude_linear`` walls an **already triangulated** mesh; it does not triangulate
      a ring, so the cap fan is built here. Its faces must be ``Int32``/``Int64`` -- a ``UInt32``
      tensor raises ``Tensor has dtype UInt32, but is expected to have dtype among {Int32, Int64}``,
      although ``RaycastingScene.add_triangles`` accepts one. Two conventions inside one API.

    Both also want 3-D points where triwarp's signature takes ``wp.vec2``, which is the only other
    transform.

    **Bug class excluded:** a wall band that skips or doubles a quad, which the face count catches,
    and an unclosed solid, which the watertightness and chi asserts catch on every side.

    Not a library comparison at this level — the reference comparisons for these surfaces are the

    What this pins is that the gate is a *performance* switch and nothing else: the two lattices

    in the last float32 bit would be a second definition of the geometry rather than a faster route

    the suite at all. The surfaces straddle the gluing rules the two paths have to agree on: a
    twisted wrap with two collapsed pole rows (``boy``, ``cross_cap``), a wrap in each direction
    (``klein``), a twist with a boundary (``mobius``), a plain open patch (``dini``) and a
