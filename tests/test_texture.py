"""
Regression tests for ``triwarp.texture``.

The forward rasterizers are compared against a vendored moderngl (OpenGL) reference; the inverse
samplers against ``scipy.ndimage.map_coordinates``. Because OpenGL's top-left edge fill rule
differs subtly from a barycentric pixel-center coverage test, comparisons of the covered/uncovered
mask allow a thin boundary band of disagreement, while interpolated values are compared only where
both rasterizers cover the pixel (the interpolated field is continuous, so values agree there).

    No correspondence is available pixel-for-pixel: OpenGL's top-left fill rule and triwarp's
    barycentric pixel-centre coverage test disagree by construction on a boundary pixel, so the
    comparison is a coverage *agreement fraction* and then an exact value check restricted to the
    pixels both rasterizers claim. The interpolated field is continuous, which is what makes the
    restriction sound rather than convenient -- where both cover, both are interpolating the same
    affine function over the same triangle.

    Measured at ``n_channels=5``: coverage agreement is **1.000000** -- the fill-rule band this
    fixture could exercise is empty -- with 82.1 % of the image covered, 3 364 jointly-covered
    pixels and a max value difference of **1.99e-04** against the ``1e-3`` bound. So the ``0.98``
    threshold is *headroom for the documented fill-rule difference, not a fitted number*; it has
    never been approached on this fixture.

    Mutation probe, and it has a trap worth recording: **transposing** triwarp's coverage mask
    also scores **1.000000**, because ``_grid_uv_mesh`` is symmetric under transposition -- so the
    obvious mutation is vacuous here and would "prove" the bound bites when it does not. A
    **shuffle** is the valid probe: it drops agreement to **0.708**, i.e. 29.2 % disagreement
    against the 2 % the
    threshold allows, a **14.6x** margin.

    off-by-one in the pixel-centre offset, a UV-to-NDC sign error, and any coverage rule wrong by
    more than a boundary pixel. What it does *not* see is a systematic half-pixel shift small enough
