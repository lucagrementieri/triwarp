"""
Run the suite on both devices, as two processes, because one process cannot do it cheaply.

``uv run python -m tests.devices`` runs a CUDA pass and then a CPU pass, and the CPU pass is
spawned with ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""``. That environment variable is the whole point of the
runner: **Warp's CPU work is ~36x slower once CUDA has been initialised in the process**, so a
single ``pytest --device=both`` pays that on every CPU parametrization. Measured on one
``heat_signed_distance`` call -- same mesh, same code, only ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` differing --
50.57 s with CUDA visible against **1.40 s** without, and the figure is unchanged by
``warp.config.launch_array_access_mode`` (``RELAXED`` 50.34 s, ``CHECKED`` 49.77 s), so it is CUDA
presence rather than CLAUDE.md section 3.9's launch guard. Whole-suite consequence: 717 s in one
process, against ~37.6 s + ~155 s as two.

Both-device coverage earns the second process. It is what caught the ``warp.fem`` ambient-device
leak in ``reconstruction._screened_poisson_adaptive`` -- broken for CPU input on any box with a GPU,
and invisible to both a CUDA-only run (devices matched) and a ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""`` run
(``warp.fem`` then defaults to CPU) -- and the module-scope ``wp.array`` in ``test_grouping``.

Usage
-----
``uv run python -m tests.devices``
    CUDA pass, then a CUDA-hidden CPU pass with the ``slow_cpu`` tests skipped. The everyday
    both-device check.
``uv run python -m tests.devices --slow-cpu``
    Same, but the CPU pass runs ``--device=both``, which in a CUDA-hidden process means "all of
    CPU, skip nothing" -- the ``slow_cpu`` Poisson tests included.
``uv run python -m tests.devices -- -x -k grouping``
    Everything after ``--`` is forwarded to both pytest invocations.

Exits non-zero if either pass does, and reports both outcomes rather than stopping at the first.
