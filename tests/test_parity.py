"""
The parity gate: a reference library that is *benchmarked* must also be *tested* against.

``benchmarks/`` asserts only shapes and finiteness, so nothing there establishes that triwarp and
the reference it is timed against compute the same thing. These tests close that loop by pairing the
benchmark suite's ``benchmark`` / ``benchlibs`` markers with the correctness suite's ``parity``
markers, and failing when a benchmarked pair is neither covered by a test nor explicitly exempted
with a written justification. See [`tests/parity.py`](parity.py) for the scanner and for the limits
of what a green gate proves.

One test per failure mode rather than one big one, so the failing test's *name* says what kind of
mistake was made. Deliberately not parametrized over the pairs: that would add hundreds of
always-green items to every run, and a pair that *disappeared* would silently lose its check instead
of failing.
