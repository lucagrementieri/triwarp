"""
Probe: which scalar uniforms ``wp.map`` accepts alongside its array inputs.

``wp.map`` is documented as mixing scalars freely with arrays, but the interesting cases for this
package are the opaque handle types — a ``wp.uint64`` acceleration-structure id, which is what lets
a mesh or BVH query live inside a mapped ``@wp.func`` instead of a hand-written kernel. If that
does not work, the affected kernels have to stay kernels regardless of how elementwise their bodies
look.

**Finding.** It works, but the handle must be wrapped explicitly as ``wp.uint64(mesh.id)``.
``wp.Mesh.id`` is a plain Python ``int``, and ``wp.map`` infers ``int32`` for that, so passing it
bare fails with ``does not support the provided argument types vec3f, int32, float32`` — a type
error naming the coerced type rather than anything about handles, which is easy to misread as
"``wp.map`` cannot do mesh queries". ``wp.launch`` needs no such wrapping, so this only bites on
conversion.

These are capability probes, not regression tests for triwarp code: they exist so a future
conversion can check the platform rather than guess. See ``.claude/CLAUDE.md`` §4.
