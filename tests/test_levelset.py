    ``getNumpyVerts`` bottoms out at (CLAUDE.md section 6). The transform is the whole content of

    of sample ``[0, 0, 0]``, ``params.origin`` is that sample's *cell* corner, so passing the same
    number to both leaves the surfaces a rigid half-voxel apart -- measured at 0.0369, exactly the
    half diagonal ``sqrt(3) * spacing / 2``, and 3e5 times the agreement the shift buys.

    *detectable*, and that is what is checked: ``half_torus``'s tube has minor radius 0.5 before
    its graded scaling, and thickening it by 0.6 makes the inward layer pass through the tube's own
    axis and out the other side. ``face_self_intersecting_mask`` flags **130** faces there and
    ``is_watertight`` -- which includes a self-intersection test, as open3d's does -- turns
    ``False``, where at 0.05 both are clean. It scales as the geometry says it should: 273 faces at
    a thickness of 1.0 and 467 at 1.5.

    A *closed* input does not fold this way, and that is worth recording because it is the obvious
    thing to test and it does not work: a unit sphere thickened by 1.5 puts its inward layer at
    radius 0.5 with the orientation inverted, which is two nested spheres -- wrong volume, no
    intersection. The tube is the shape whose normals actually converge.

    The alternative for such a thickness is named in the docstring and exercised here: a level-set
    ``offset_mesh`` cannot self-intersect by construction, and does not.
