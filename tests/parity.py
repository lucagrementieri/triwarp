"""
Cross-suite parity bookkeeping: which benchmarked reference libraries are also *tested* against.

``benchmarks/`` times triwarp against every reference in ``benchmarks/conftest.py``'s
``LIBRARIES`` -- ten CPU-only baselines plus ``pytorch3d``, which carries CUDA kernels of its own
and so takes two rows -- but only ever asserts shapes and
finiteness -- its ``pytest_generate_tests`` parametrizes over ``(mesh_name, library)``, so one
benchmark invocation holds exactly one library's result and *cannot* compare them. That leaves room
for a benchmark to race two implementations computing different things and report the ratio as if it
meant something.

This module reads both suites statically and pairs them up:

- a benchmark declares what it times with ``@pytest.mark.benchmark(group=...)`` +
  ``@pytest.mark.benchlibs(...)``, and declares a reference whose *result* is not comparable with
  ``@pytest.mark.noparity("<library>", reason="...")``;
- a correctness test declares what it proves with ``@pytest.mark.parity("<group>", "<library>")``,
  and declares a reference it tests but which is deliberately *not* timed with
  ``@pytest.mark.parity("<group>", "<library>", benchmarked=False, reason="...")``.

[`tests/test_parity.py`](test_parity.py) then fails the default test run on any benchmarked pair
that is neither covered nor exempt. Run ``python -m tests.parity`` for the full matrix.

Why a static ``ast`` scan rather than pytest collection
-------------------------------------------------------
Importing the benchmark modules would execute ``benchmarks/conftest.py`` -- a bare
``from meshes import ...``, a ``pytest_addoption`` that cannot be registered twice, and the
``open3d`` / ``pymeshlab`` / ``meshio`` imports. More decisively, a collection hook sees only
*selected* items, so ``pytest tests/test_edges.py`` or ``-k centroid`` would report almost every
pair as uncovered -- wrong in exactly the runs developers do most. A static scan is independent of
selection, ordering, import health and device, so the gate's verdict is identical however pytest was
invoked. This module therefore imports **nothing** outside the standard library.

What a green gate does *not* mean
---------------------------------
**The inputs differ.** Benchmarks run on scan meshes (``bunny``, ``dragon``, ``lucy``); tests run on
the ``tests/conftest.py`` fixtures. Parity on a 42-vertex icosahedron does not establish parity on
``bunny``, where degeneracies, unreferenced vertices and float32 thresholds bite.

**Equivalence may be partial.** The marker asserts that *a* test compares the two; the nature of the
comparison lives in the test body, where a reduction, a unit fix or a gauge projection may stand
between the two answers. Green proves a human looked, not that the semantics match.
