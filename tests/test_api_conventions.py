"""
The convention gate: the public API's names, summaries and file layout, checked statically.

One test per convention, so the failing test's *name* says which one was broken. The scan and the
reasoning behind each rule live in [`tests/api_conventions.py`](api_conventions.py); this file is
only the pytest surface -- with two exceptions, both of which exist because a static read cannot
see what they check: the docstring-example test, which executes the examples, and the lazy-package
tests at the end, which import `triwarp` in a *subprocess* because the in-process import graph is
already whatever the session made it.

Deliberately not parametrized over modules or functions: that would add hundreds of always-green
items to every run, and a rule that stopped matching anything would silently lose its check instead
of failing. The example test *is* parametrized, because there are four of them and the failure has
to name which one.
