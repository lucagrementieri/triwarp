    Not merely within tolerance -- **exactly** 0.0 on this fixture, because the two implementations

    cross product normalized for the normal. Worth having as a separate test from the trimesh one
    for that reason: a reference that agrees to 1e-7 leaves room for a different summation order,
    and one that agrees to 0.0 does not.

    Note the areas come back **float32** whatever the ``Meshes`` was built from -- the C++ kernel
    casts -- so a float64 comparison here would be measuring pytorch3d's own downcast.

    The ``Meshes`` is built on the **triwarp side's own device**, which is what makes the exact
    claim hold on both: pytorch3d has separate CPU and CUDA kernels, and each agrees bit-for-bit

    comparison lands at 1.86e-09 on the areas and 1.19e-07 on the normals. So this is also one of

    The three references that each answer *half* of this function, so the benchmark can be read.

    ``face_normals_and_areas`` returns both quantities from one cross product, and the benchmark
    reads these three rows as a floor rather than a fair race because each computes less. That makes
    them no *less* valid as oracles, only partial. All three are Class B -- exact transforms, full
    ``1e-5`` tolerance:

    - ``igl.doublearea`` is literally twice the area, so the transform is a factor of two;
    - ``potpourri3d.face_areas`` is the area directly, and is pure numpy rather than
      geometry-central, so it is the weakest of the three as independent evidence;
    - MeshLab's ``compute_normal_per_face`` turns out to check **both** halves, not one.
      ``face_normal_matrix()`` returns the *unnormalised* cross product: measured on this fixture
      its magnitude is ``2 * area`` to within 1e-15 across every face, and its direction matches
      trimesh's unit normals exactly. So dividing by the magnitude gives the normal and halving the
      magnitude gives the area, and this row is a full oracle rather than a partial one. Do not
      "fix" a failure here by normalising triwarp's side -- triwarp's normals are already unit, and
      the magnitude is the area check.

    Uses ``half_torus`` rather than ``icosahedron`` so the areas actually vary across faces: on a

    The weighting is the finding this row exists to pin. MeshLib's per-corner normals are

    and sit **0.244** from ``weighting="angle"`` on ``unit_box`` and 0.521 on a cylinder. Which is
    the same split MeshLib already forces on the *vertex* normals (``computePerVertNormals`` pairs
    with area weighting, ``computePerVertPseudoNormals`` with angle), so it is a convention this
    reference distinguishes and the others do not.

    Both crease cases are run because they exercise different code: with ``None`` every rotation
    about a vertex completes and the answer collapses to the vertex normal, while at 0.5 rad the
    walk stops at hard edges and the per-corner answer is the point of the function. Measured 0.0 on
    ``unit_box`` with its 12 creases and 6e-08 on a cylinder with 96 of 192.

    The fixtures are **closed and undistorted** deliberately. On ``half_torus``, whose conftest
    fixture scales its vertices by ``exp(-y)``, the same comparison reads **1.8e-05** -- a float32
    floor rather than a disagreement, because at 0.5 rad that mesh has 1 099 creases and a

    Class A for three per-face families at once, all element-wise in face order.

    MeshLib is the fourth independent implementation of these, and it is the one that pins two
    conventions the others leave open. Its ``computePerFaceNormals`` is **normalized** (|n| = 1 to
    6e-08 measured), unlike pymeshlab's ``face_normal_matrix()``, which is the raw cross product at
    magnitude ``2 * area``; and its ``triangleAspectRatio`` is exactly the measure
    [`face_quality`][triwarp.triangles.face_quality] calls ``aspect_ratio`` -- **0.0** difference,
    where pyvista names the same quantity ``radius_ratio`` and igl gives it only as a ratio of two
    other arrays.

    One named transform, the same one ``igl.doublearea`` needs: ``dblArea`` is twice the area.
    Everything else is direct. Three of MeshLib's four entry points here are **per-face** rather
    than batched, so they are looped on the reference side -- fine in a test at this size, and the
    reason ``benchmarks/`` reads those rows as an upper bound (see section 6).

    The fourth family is the corner angles, and MeshLib reaches them two ways: ``mm.angle(a, b)``
    on the two corner vectors (Class B -- the transform is building those vectors, and MeshLib's
    ``atan2(|cross|, dot)`` form is a different formulation from an ``acos`` of the normalized dot,
    which is what makes it worth comparing) and ``sumAngles`` per vertex, which must equal the
    table's per-vertex sum (Class A, and the quantity ``vertex_defects`` subtracts from 2pi).
    Measured on ``half_torus``: **2.38e-07** on the corners and **1.07e-06** on the vertex sums.

    Testing the four together is deliberate: they come out of the same corner load, so a
    fixture-level disagreement (a converter dropping a vertex, a face buffer reshaped wrong) shows
    up in all of them at once and is distinguishable from a real per-quantity bug.

    a real parameter rather than a decoration, and it is the axis ``sample.sample_volume`` uses --
