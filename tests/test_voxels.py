"""
Tests for ``triwarp.voxels``.

Four references, each where it is the closest thing to an oracle: **open3d** for the two
voxelizers, the down-sample and the membership query (it computes the same tri-box accept set and
the same half-voxel anchor); **scipy.ndimage** through trimesh's ``voxel.morphology`` for dilation,
erosion and hole filling, which are exactly its binary morphology; **trimesh** for
``fill_orthographic`` and ``multibox``; and **igl** for ``grid`` and
``unique_sparse_voxel_corners``.

Two conventions matter throughout:

- **Every fixture is translated by a non-round offset.** open3d floors cell coordinates in
  ``float64`` and triwarp in ``float32``, so a vertex sitting exactly on a cell plane can land in
  different cells. Nothing here is allowed to sit on that edge.
- **Row order is leaf-major**, not lexicographic, so every set comparison sorts both sides. The
  order is nonetheless deterministic and identical on CPU and CUDA, which
  ``test_cell_order_is_deterministic`` and ``test_cell_order_matches_across_devices`` assert
  directly — the device-agnostic design rests on it.

The module runs on the ordinary ``device`` fixture like every other one: ``allocate_by_voxels``
gained a CPU path in Warp 1.16, so nothing here is CUDA-only.

    Class C (two representations): MeshLib returns a **distance field**, not an occupancy set.

    ``meshToVolume`` builds an OpenVDB narrow band -- unsigned distances in *voxel* units, clamped
    at ``surfaceOffset`` -- so there is no cell set to compare with. What is comparable is the
    geometry both encode, and the two directions of that are exact statements rather than
    tolerances:

    - a cell triwarp accepts contains a piece of the surface, so its **centre** is within half a
      cell diagonal of it: ``distance <= sqrt(3)/2`` voxels;
    - a grid node whose distance is under **half** a voxel has its closest surface point inside the
      surrounding cell, so triwarp must have accepted that cell.

    Measured on the translated ``icosphere(3)`` at a 0.1 voxel: all 1 898 accepted cells sample at
    most **0.806** against the 0.866 bound, and all 1 226 nodes under 0.5 land inside an accepted
    cell -- both at 100 %, in both directions.

    Three facts about the grid, none of them documented and all of them load-bearing. The field is
    read through ``vdbVolumeToSimpleVolume`` and ``mn.getNumpy3Darray``; its samples sit on grid
    **nodes**, not cell centres; and its origin is ``bbox.min - surfaceOffset * voxel``, which is
    also why ``dims`` comes out as the mesh's extent in cells plus ``2 * surfaceOffset``.

    **Bug class excluded:** a grid anchored differently -- the failure mode every voxel comparison
    in this module is written against. **Mutation probe, measured:** displacing the sample points by
    half a voxel puts **19.3 %** of the cells outside the bound and takes the maximum from 0.806 to

    Class B: ``trimesh.voxel.VoxelGrid.is_filled`` evaluated at the new cell centres.

    That is the membership test ``VoxelGrid.revoxelized`` runs internally, and the reason the
    comparison goes through it rather than through ``revoxelized`` itself is that ``revoxelized``
    samples on ``grid_linspace(self.bounds, shape)`` — ``shape`` points spanning the box
    *inclusive*, so a step of ``extents / (shape - 1)`` — and then attaches a transform whose scale
    is ``extents / shape``. The two disagree, and the visible consequence is that a completely
    filled 2x2x2 grid resampled to ``(8, 8, 8)`` comes back with 343 = 7^3 cells filled rather than
    512: the far face of samples lands exactly on the boundary and reads as empty. So there is no
    pitch a caller can ask ``revoxelized`` for that lands on the lattice triwarp resamples onto.

    Three settings, so the claim is not a coarsening claim alone: unchanged (exact round trip),
    halved (refinement, which must be hole-free — this is why the rule is "the new centre lands in
    an old cell" rather than "voxelize the old centres") and tripled.

    Tripled rather than doubled on purpose: an **even** integer coarsening puts every new cell
    centre exactly on a face of the old lattice (``origin + (2c + 1) * old_size``), where triwarp's
    float32 floor and trimesh's float64 round are free to disagree. Measured — at ``2.0`` this
    comparison fails on cells at the ties. Odd and fractional factors land strictly inside an old
    cell and the two agree exactly.

    it should be: all three of ``"topleft"`` / ``"corner"`` / ``"center"`` return the *identical*
