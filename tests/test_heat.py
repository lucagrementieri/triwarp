Regression tests for ``triwarp.heat`` against igl, potpourri3d, pymeshlab and pyvista.

Three solvers in one file, in the module's own source order: the scalar heat method, the signed
heat method, then the vector-valued family. Each section's references and its comparison hazards
are described where it begins.

Signed heat method: the source curves
-------------------------------------
Every curve here is a **vertex one-ring cycle**, for a reason that is easy to trip over:
``potpourri3d.MeshSignedHeatSolver`` rejects a curve whose consecutive points do not share a face
("Each curve segment must be contained within a single face"), so an arbitrary vertex list is
not a valid source for it. A one-ring cycle is the smallest curve that is genuinely edge-connected,
closed, *and* separating — which is what makes the sign meaningful — and it comes straight out of
[`vertex_one_rings`][triwarp.halfedge.vertex_one_rings].

The strongest check is not against the reference at all: the *magnitude* of the signed field has to
agree with the unsigned [`heat_geodesic`][triwarp.heat.heat_geodesic] distance to the same
curve, which is a completely different solve.

Vector heat method: comparing tangent fields
--------------------------------------------
Comparing tangent fields across libraries needs care in two places, and both are load-bearing here:

* **The source vector.** ``(1, 0)`` means "along *my* reference direction", and the two libraries
  choose different ones, so handing both the literal ``(1, 0)`` transports two different world
  vectors. Every comparison below converts the source vector into the reference library's frame
  first.
* **The result.** 2D components are meaningless across libraries; the fields are compared after
  expanding them to 3D through each library's own frames.

    Class C (a bound against the truth): two approximations of the same geodesic field.

    ``computeSurfaceDistances`` is fast marching -- a serial front over the edge graph solving the
    local Eikonal update -- where ``heat_geodesic`` is Crane et al.'s heat method. Neither is exact
    on a triangulation, so comparing them to each other alone would be a claim about two errors. The
    sphere is the fixture that fixes that: its geodesics are great-circle arcs, so the *exact*
    answer is known and each method can be measured against it.

    Measured from one source on ``icosphere(3)``, as the worst absolute deviation from the exact
    arc length: triwarp **0.0515** and meshlib **0.0442**, i.e. 1.6 % and 1.4 % of the field's
    range. The two agree with each other to **0.067** with a correlation of **0.99983** -- so they
    differ from each other by about as much as each differs from the truth, which is the honest
    statement about two first-order methods and is what the asserts encode.

    Its ``startVertices`` is a ``VertBitSet`` over the vertex domain -- there is no index-list
    overload for the single-source case -- and the result is a ``VertScalars``, read through
    [`meshlib_scalars_to_numpy`][tests.conversions.meshlib_scalars_to_numpy] since ``np.asarray``
    on one silently yields a 0-d object array.

    **Mutation probe**, and what it says is that the three asserts divide the work unevenly. The
    measured errors against the exact field are 0.0515 (triwarp) and 0.0442 (meshlib) against a
    0.1571 bar, and the correlation is 0.99983 against a 0.999 bar. Mutating the triwarp field:

    | mutation      | error vs the 5 % bar | correlation vs the 0.999 bar |
    |---------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
    | shuffle       | 2.753 -- **fails**   | -0.014 -- **fails**          |
    | scale x1.10   | 0.273 -- **fails**   | 0.99983 -- passes            |
    | scale x1.05   | 0.124 -- passes      | 0.99983 -- passes            |

    So the **correlation cannot see a scale error at all** (it is scale-invariant), and the error
    bar is what carries that half -- but only past ~5 %, because the bar *is* 5 % and the field
    already spends a third of it on discretization. That is the honest limit of this comparison and
    not a threshold to tighten: 5 % is where two first-order methods genuinely sit, which the
    paragraph above already argues. A finer claim needs a finer mesh, not a smaller number.

    match. The named transform is how the source is specified: MeshLab has no source argument at all
    and takes the current *selection*, so ``compute_selection_by_condition_per_vertex`` with
    ``"(vi == 0)"`` is what pins it to vertex 0, and the answer is read off
    ``vertex_scalar_array()`` rather than returned. Exactly what the benchmark does.

    **Measured across the three fixtures:** mean error **0.000 / 0.002 / 0.019%** of the diameter
    and maximum **0.000 / 0.006 / 0.966%** -- within a factor of two of the potpourri3d comparison's
    own numbers, on a completely separate codebase, which is what makes this worth its lines. The
    bounds below are the same ones that comparison uses, so they sit >50x and 5x off the measured
    values.

    **Bug class excluded:** a wrong timestep or a wrong mass lumping. Both leave the field smooth,
    monotone and zero at the source -- so they pass every self-consistency test in this module --
    and both shift the whole field by several percent, which two independent references pin down.

    Class C, a two-sided bound on a value with no correspondence to compare against.

    VTK's ``geodesic_distance`` is ``vtkDijkstraGraphGeodesicPath`` -- the shortest path along mesh
    *edges*, so it is an **upper** bound on the true geodesic (a path confined to edges cannot beat
    one free to cross faces), while the straight-line distance is a **lower** bound on it. The heat
    method returns a smoothed approximation of the quantity in between, which is why this is a bound
    and not an ``allclose``: nothing here is the same number.

    **Bug class excluded:** a field on the wrong *scale*. A wrong timestep, a missing mass lumping
    or a lost square root all leave the field smooth, monotone and zero at the source -- so every
    self-consistency test in this module still passes -- while moving its magnitude, and the upper
    bound is sharp enough to see that. Measured ``heat / graph`` over 20 random targets per fixture:
    max **0.866 / 0.983 / 0.934 / 0.969**, so a field inflated by more than ~2% on ``hemisphere``
    fails it (a 1.5x scaling fails on all four).

    The lower bound is checked only at the Euclidean-**farthest** vertex, and that restriction is
    the finding rather than a convenience: at short range the heat method *undershoots* the
    straight-line distance, measured 0.911 against 1.051 between adjacent-ish vertices of the
    icosahedron and 0.728 against 0.829 on ``half_torus``. So "heat >= Euclidean" is false in
    general and true where the two are far apart -- margins there are 36% / 53% / 0.5% / 30%, the
    thin one being ``half_torus``, whose farthest pair is nearly straight-line reachable across its

    Class C (correlation plus a mean-error bound): the two fields have no correspondence to assert.

    Both sides solve the same continuous problem but through different boundary handling at the
    curve, so a vertex-wise ``allclose`` is not available at any tolerance -- what *is* shared is
    the sign convention and the shape of the field. The bug class this excludes is the one that
    matters here: a sign flip, a scale error, or a field ignoring the curve would each break a 0.9
    correlation and a mean error under 5 % of the mesh diagonal. Measured margins are in the comment
    below, and the correlation is the tighter constraint (0.996 and 0.940 against the 0.9 bar).

    **Mutation probe** (30 permutations, both fixtures), and it shows the two statistics are
    complementary rather than redundant -- neither alone excludes the whole bug class:

    | mutation             | correlation      | mean error vs its bar        |
    |----------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
    | shuffle one side     | 0.73 / 0.21      | 0.487 / 0.478 vs 0.147 / 0.150 -- **fails** |
    | negate one side      | -0.996 / -0.940 -- **fails** | unchanged in magnitude |
    | scale one side x1.5  | unchanged (scale-invariant) | 0.284 / 0.533 -- **fails** |

    So the correlation catches the sign flip and the error bound catches the scale error and the
    shuffle, which is the division of labour the docstring above claims. One caveat worth carrying:
    on ``hemisphere`` the measured mean error is **0.1259 against a 0.1500 bar -- 1.19x**, well
    inside section 7.4's 3x preference, because that curve sits one ring from the rim where the two
