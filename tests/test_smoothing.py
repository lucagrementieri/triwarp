    Not a library comparison: MeshLib's ``inflate`` is a different operation, measured.

    It is the only reference that has one, and it cannot be compared. With **every** vertex selected
    -- the whole-mesh inflation this function performs -- it collapses the sphere to the origin at
    every pressure probed (1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 0.05, 0.5: max radius 0.0000 each time), because its
    implicit solve takes the unselected vertices as its Dirichlet condition, and selecting all of
    them leaves the system with no anchor. Given a **region** it runs, but solves a different
    problem: on a 223-vertex cap of ``icosphere(3)`` the volume goes 4.153 to 2.843 -- *below* the
    input, since the implicit Laplacian flattens the cap onto its pinned rim before the pressure
    pushes back -- and then rises with pressure (2.843 / 2.847 / 2.865 at 0.001 / 0.01 / 0.05). Only
    the monotonicity is shared, and that is too weak to be a parity claim.

    So the properties carry it, and each excludes something a volume alone would not:

    * **volume monotone in the pressure**, which excludes a flow that smooths without inflating --
      measured 4.153 unchanged at zero, 4.540 at 0.1 mean-edge and 6.328 at 0.5;
    * **displacement normal-aligned**, mean cosine 0.959 and 0.998 at those pressures, ruling out
      growing the volume by shearing;
    * **watertight and free of self-intersections**, which is what a caller depends on;
    * **pressure zero is the identity in volume**, which is the tightest of the four: any change
      there would be the displacement leaking, since ``filter_laplacian``'s volume constraint is on.

    Class C against ``smoothRegionBoundary``: identical moved sets, agreeing rim curves.

    Class C rather than A because the two are not the same algorithm end to end. Both pin a field
    to -1 on the region and +1 outside, solve its harmonic interpolation over the band that touches
    both, and slide those vertices onto the zero level set -- but meshlib first **flips** the band's
    interior edges to improve the configuration, which changes the connectivity and therefore the
    level set. This port deliberately does not (it promises the face buffer back untouched), so the
    positions cannot match element-wise.

    What does match, and is asserted: the set of vertices that move is **exactly equal** (44 of 642
    at ``subdivisions=3``, 112 of 2 562 at 4), the rim's total length agrees within 1 % (6.073
    against 6.107, and 6.024 against 6.049), the per-vertex displacement magnitudes correlate at
    **0.984-0.987**, and the largest position disagreement is **0.0052** against displacements
    reaching 0.15 -- a 29x margin. The bug class excluded is a band that slides the wrong way or
    off the surface: both sides keep every moved vertex within **0.0021** of the unit sphere, which
    a projection onto the wrong level set would not.

    The invariant asserted alongside is the function's actual purpose and no comparison implies it:
    the rim gets **shorter**. Two mesh resolutions because the level set is a property of the
    surface, not of the triangulation, so the claim has to survive refining it.

    !!! note "The divergence is real on a ragged selection"
        Where the region is speckled with isolated single-face islands on a *coarse* mesh, meshlib's
        edge flips are doing most of the work and this port's rim can end up slightly longer than
        the input (measured 40.32 against meshlib's 38.86 on a 15 %-speckled ``icosphere(3)``,
        against an input of 39.46). Refining the mesh removes the gap. The fixtures here are a
        clean threshold selection, which is the case the function is for.

    Class B: exact under the same operator substitution as the Laplacian test above.

    See [`test_filter_laplacian_matches_pymeshlab`]
    [tests.test_smoothing.test_filter_laplacian_matches_pymeshlab] for how the operator is derived.

    ``apply_coord_unsharp_mask`` takes ``weight`` and ``iterations`` under triwarp's own names and
    meanings, and ``weightorig=1.0`` is its default (the original-position weight triwarp fixes at
    1), so the only transform is passing
    [`_meshlab_umbrella`][tests.test_smoothing._meshlab_umbrella] as the smoothing operator.

    Measured **1.4e-07** at both 1 and 5 iterations, against **1.5e-03 / 4.4e-03** with the plain
    1-ring mean -- so, like the Laplacian test, this doubles as the check on which umbrella the
    filter uses.
