    an edge list, so the named transform is to mark ``C[f, i]`` for every face-corner whose edge is
    in triwarp's cut set. On the cube cut at every crease igl emits **24 vertices, exactly triwarp's
    answer**, against MeshLab's 32 -- which is the point of having a third implementation on this
    group: 24 is minimal and now independently confirmed, so MeshLab's extra 8 are its own.

    **The corner numbering is ``(i, i + 1)`` here, unlike ``igl.ears``.** ``cut_mesh``'s edge ``i``
    of face ``f`` is ``(F[f, i], F[f, (i + 1) % 3])`` -- the same convention triwarp uses -- where
    ``igl.ears`` inherits ``igl::on_boundary``'s *opposite-vertex* numbering. The two conventions
    coexist inside one library, so the mask is built with the ``(i, i + 1)`` rule and the
    alternative is checked to be wrong rather than assumed: it yields 28 vertices, so a
    convention slip would fail this test rather than pass it.
