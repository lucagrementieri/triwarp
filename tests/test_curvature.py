    Class B on the principal *direction*, which is the only quantity MeshLab exposes comparably.

    ``compute_curvature_principal_directions_per_vertex`` writes two direction matrices and its
    ``vertex_curvature_principal_dir1_matrix()`` entries are **unit vectors** -- measured ``|d1| ==
    1`` at every vertex -- so the curvature *magnitudes* are simply not in them. Its scalar output
    is a mean curvature over a neighbourhood MeshLab derives itself rather than from a radius, and
    it correlates 0.94 with triwarp's with a systematic offset (max deviation 0.82), so it is not a
    value oracle either. The direction is, and the transform is the usual eigenvector sign freedom:
    an eigenvector is defined up to sign, so the comparison is ``|dot| == 1``.

    **Fixture choice is the substance here.** Principal directions are only defined where the two
    principal curvatures differ, so ``torus`` -- whose curvature gap is at minimum 2.63 and median
    3.25 -- is the fixture, and the two obvious alternatives are excluded for measured reasons: on
    an ``icosphere`` every point is umbilic (``k1 == k2``, so any orthonormal tangent pair is a
    valid answer and the agreement reads a meaningless 0.62), and ``half_torus``'s gap falls to
    0.096, where only 54% of vertices reach ``|dot| > 0.99``.

    **Measured, and the mutation probes.** On ``torus`` the worst ``|dot|`` over all 1 024 vertices
    is **0.9997** against a 0.99 bound -- a 33x margin on the deviation from 1. Pairing triwarp's
    first direction with MeshLab's *second* instead collapses it to a mean of 0.058 and only 2.3% of
    vertices above the bound; comparing it against the vertex normal gives a mean of 0.002 and 0%.
    So neither an axis swap nor "return any tangent vector" survives.

    MeshLab's second direction is deliberately **not** asserted: 94.8% of vertices agree to 0.99 but
    the remaining 5% fall to 0.009, i.e. MeshLab and triwarp order the two eigenvectors differently
    at some vertices. That is an ordering convention, and pinning the first direction is the part
    that says the two computed the same shape operator.

    ``autoclean=False`` is load-bearing: the filter defaults to deleting unreferenced vertices,
    which would silently renumber the output against triwarp's.

    Not a library comparison: ``PD1`` and ``PD2`` must span the tangent plane, never coincide.

    The two principal directions are eigenvectors of a 2x2 shape operator, and on a surface whose
    curvature aligns with the tangent frame the fit built, that operator comes out **diagonal**.
    That is the case the curved fixtures never reach and the one where reading the eigenvector off
    a single fixed row of ``m - lam*I`` fails: for the eigenvalue equal to ``m00`` the top row is
    the zero row, so it has to be read off the second row instead. ``parabolic_lattice`` reaches it
    at every vertex whose reference tangent lands on a grid direction, which is what that fixture
    exists for.

    Measured, and it is the discriminator: before the second-row fallback, **41 of 441** vertices
    here returned ``PD1 == (0, 1, 0)`` and ``PD2 == (0, -1, 0)`` -- parallel, so the max-curvature
    direction was 90 degrees off -- and 22 of 441 did on ``cuda:0``, identically for both
    ``frame_independent`` modes.

    **The orthogonality assert is no longer what catches that**, and the analytic-direction asserts
    below are, which is worth stating because it is not obvious: the second direction is now a
    cross product with the normal, so the pair is orthonormal by construction whether or not the
    *first* direction is right. Mutation-probed by restoring the single-row eigenvector -- both
    parametrized arms then fail at "PD1 must run along the flat ruling" and nothing else. That is
    the assert this fixture exists for; orthogonality is the sibling test's job.

    The fixture is checked for non-vacuity two ways: every vertex must produce a frame at all (a
    failed fit returns zeros and would pass an orthogonality test trivially), and the field must
    actually be anisotropic, or the directions would be arbitrary at an umbilic point -- which is
    the sibling case ``test_principal_directions_are_a_frame_at_an_umbilic_point`` covers.

    The directions are also checked against the answer this surface has by hand, which is what
    says the fix picked the *right* pair of axes rather than merely two different ones. A parabolic
    cylinder is developable: it bends across the ruling (x) and is flat along it (y). Under the
    ``PV1 >= PV2`` ordering that makes ``PD1`` the *flat* direction, because the surface curves

    fixture (the agreement reads a meaningless 0.62) and picks ``torus`` instead. What is still a
    contract, and what nothing asserted before, is that the pair is a **frame**: two orthonormal
    vectors spanning the tangent plane. The helper that answers a degenerate 2x2 returns the
    reference frame's own two axes, so which frame it is depends on the vertex numbering, but that
    it is *a* frame does not.

    ``test_principal_directions_stay_orthogonal_on_an_axis_aligned_field``, which covers the

    eigenvectors are determined, here they coincide and only the invariant survives. The curvature

    point does determine.

    and an earlier single-radius version of this test caught that mutation only through the
    tangency assert, which is a weaker and more incidental guard.

    radius 2 / 3 / 5 / 8 against a true ``1 / r`` of 1.0. That is a property of the method, not a

    """
    Class A against a closed form: on a torus the principal directions are the parameter curves.

    Not a library comparison, and that is the point rather than a shortfall. The reference
    libraries cover this function unevenly: igl is an oracle for ``frame_independent=False`` only
    (it *is* the symmetrized operator that flag reproduces), and pymeshlab's
    ``vertex_curvature_principal_dir1_matrix`` is asserted for ``PD1`` alone, because its two
    directions are ordered differently from triwarp's at 5% of vertices. That left ``PD2`` in the
    default ``frame_independent=True`` branch -- the output most sensitive to how the second
    eigenvector is obtained -- with no reference comparison at all. A torus has one.

    A torus of revolution is a principal-coordinate surface: its meridians (around the tube) and
    its parallels (around the axis) are the lines of curvature everywhere, with curvatures ``1/r``
    and ``cos(theta) / (R + r cos(theta))``. Those two families are recovered here from the vertex
    positions alone -- no fit, no library -- so this is an exact oracle for the *directions*, which
    is what the assert reads. The magnitudes are left to the igl and pymeshlab comparisons above,
    since the quadric fit's cap bias makes them a weaker claim than the directions.

    Measured: ``min |cos|`` is **1.0000** for both families over all 1024 vertices, in both modes.
    Before the second direction was derived as a cross product it was 1.0000 for the meridians and
    **0.0000** for the parallels -- the returned pair failed to contain one of the two lines of
    curvature at all on some vertices -- which is the regression this pins. The bar is 0.99, and
    the fixture cannot be vacuous: on this torus the two principal curvatures differ by at least
    1.79 everywhere, so there is no umbilic vertex for the directions to be arbitrary at.
