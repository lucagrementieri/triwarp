    a disjoint union of cycles; walking it from any vertex covers all 78 and closes. One loop of

    Both report an ear as ``(face, index of the non-boundary edge)`` and both find the same faces,
    but the *edge numbering* differs and the difference is exactly a cyclic shift:

    - triwarp numbers local edge ``i`` as ``(faces[f, i], faces[f, (i + 1) % 3])``;
    - libigl's ``ears`` reads its mask from ``on_boundary``, whose column ``i`` is documented as
      "whether **opposite** facet is on boundary" -- edge ``i`` is the one *opposite vertex* ``i``,
      i.e. ``(faces[f, (i + 1) % 3], faces[f, (i + 2) % 3])``.

    So ``triwarp_opp == (igl_opp + 1) % 3``, and that is the named transform. Neither convention is
    wrong; ``boundary.ears``'s docstring states triwarp's.

    **This test replaces a vacuous one.** The previous version compared the two libraries on
    ``hemisphere`` and ``half_torus``, where *neither* returns any ear at all -- the assert was
    ``[] == []`` on both fixtures, so the numbering difference went unnoticed and any regression
    would have too. The inputs here are the smallest meshes that produce ears, and each case asserts
    the expected count first, so an implementation returning nothing fails rather than passes.

    The last assert is the one that does not lean on igl: for every reported ear it checks against
    ``oriented_boundary_edges`` that the two edges *other* than ``ear_opp`` really are boundary
