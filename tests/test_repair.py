    A surface that crosses itself along a *curve* rather than in a band has no canonical repair --

    two decide differently. Measured, both ending in a watertight one-component solid with no

    the gap is the question rather than either answer. So this test asserts the post-conditions on
    both sides and records the divergence instead of bounding it -- a surface bound here would
    either be loose enough to mean nothing or would pin one library's sacrifice as correct.

    ``strong_degeneracy_removal`` deletes zero-area faces, refills what that opens and iterates, so
    the comparison is on the recovered mesh rather than on which faces went: appending ``k``
    zero-area triangles to an ``icosphere(2)`` (each a duplicated vertex, so the area is exactly
    zero in ``float64`` and in ``float32``), both sides come back at **162 v / 320 f, watertight,
    Euler characteristic 2, volume 4.0470** -- the clean sphere, for ``k`` = 1 and 3. The transform
    is that pymeshfix's loader cuts before the removal runs (163 v in, 165 v loaded), so only the
    recovered counts are comparable, not the intermediate.

    The near-degenerate class is where they part, and it is a *precision* difference rather than a
    tolerance one: TMesh's coordinates are ``double``, so a flat 12-column strip offset by ``1e-9``
    is **not** degenerate to it and comes back unchanged at 24 v / 22 f, where triwarp's ``float32``
    altitude test removes the whole strip. On the *exactly* collinear version of the same strip both
    reduce it to 0 v / 0 f. So this comparison runs on exact degeneracy on purpose -- a

    Class A on the *post-condition*, through two detectors that are not triwarp's.

    No reference does this **repair** the way this does -- MeshLib's ``localFixSelfIntersections``
    subdivides and relaxes rather than cutting and refilling, and on this very input it makes the
    problem *worse*: by this file's own detector it doubles the intersecting faces while
    quintupling the face count, where this leaves **0**. So the *outputs* are not comparable, and
    the claim about them is the contract: the intersecting faces are gone, the result is
    watertight, and the surface did not run away from the input. MeshLib's local fixer is not a
    weaker version of this repair, it is a different operation that does not converge on this
    input -- it *does* clear a self-intersecting torus built the other way (the ``tangle`` axis in
    ``benchmarks/test_repair.py``), so its behaviour is fixture-dependent and neither reading
    generalizes.

    What *is* a library comparison is the contract's own predicate. Asserting it with
    [`face_self_intersecting_mask`][triwarp.validation.face_self_intersecting_mask] alone would
    check triwarp's repair against triwarp's detector, so a shared bug in the detector passes both
    sides -- and that detector is exactly the one MeshLib and pymeshfix are already the oracles for
    one group over. Both are therefore counted here, before and after: all three agree on the
    input's intersecting-face count and on zero after the repair, at both dilation budgets.
    Agreement on the *input* is what makes the assertion non-vacuous -- the fixture's count is
    confirmed by two independent implementations rather than asserted against itself.

    Only meshlib is *claimed* here, because it is the pair this group times and a test may name a
    group once; pymeshfix's claim sits on ``test_fix_self_intersections_voxel_rebuilds``, which
    consults it on the other method. Its assert runs on both regardless.

    The two detectors are asked with the conventions they have, which makes them unequally strict
    and is worth knowing if one of them ever fails alone. MeshLib is passed
    ``touchIsIntersection=False``, triwarp's convention; pymeshfix has no such switch and counts a
    *touching* pair, so its zero is the **stronger** statement -- and where the two conventions
    diverge they differ by a lot rather than a little (elsewhere in this file, dozens of faces
    against zero). The cut-and-refill leaves no touching pair, so they coincide here.

    The Hausdorff bound is the one that stops a trivial pass: deleting the whole mesh also has no
    self-intersections. It is two-sided against the input and must stay within a fraction of the
    bounding-box diagonal -- the repair cuts a band out and refills it, so it moves the surface
    locally and nowhere else.

    Both dilation budgets are run because they take different amounts of surface with them, and
    both must land clean.

    A tetrahedron is four interior valence-3 vertices each adjacent to the other three -- the

    this function was once written against. Moving all four from the input positions maps it to

    Flattening a maximal independent set per pass, lowest index wins, and repeating is not merely
    *a* fix but exactly meshlib's: it sweeps its vertices sequentially, reading neighbours it has
    already moved, and the two rules coincide vertex for vertex, because a vertex is selected in
    the pass after the last of its lower-indexed candidate neighbours -- which is when a sequential
    index-order sweep would reach it. Measured: identical to **1.19e-07** here and to **0.0** on a
    subdivided tetrahedron. Four passes, which is what makes ``max_iter`` load-bearing rather than
    decorative -- at ``max_iter=1`` only one vertex moves.

    Asserted alongside: each moved vertex lands in its three neighbours' plane at the time it
    moves, and the signed volume does not flip. The all-four pass measured +0.099 against

    Class A on the topology, through chi and the manifold predicates as other libraries read them.

    **No library performs this repair.** MeshLib's ``eliminateTunnels`` is the only binding and it
    is a **no-op** on every input probed -- measured on a 2 048-face torus and a genus-2 union, at
    ``maxTunnelLength`` of 4.0 and of 1e9, at ``maxIters`` 1 / 2 / 5 / 100, at all three
    ``TunnelLoopType`` values, with ``buildCoLoops`` off, and through the ``FillHoleNicelySettings``
    overload: identical face count and identical Euler characteristic every time. Its detector
    *does* fire on the same mesh (``detectTunnelFaces`` returns 128 faces, ``detectBasisTunnels``
    two loops), so this is the "a reference's zero is not always off" case, not a wiring mistake.

    So the *output* has nothing to be compared against, and the invariant carries the claim: cutting
    a surface along a non-separating cycle and sealing the two rims drops the genus by **one**, so
    chi must rise by exactly ``2 * removed``. What the invariant must not do is measure itself.
    Read only through [`euler_characteristic`][triwarp.measures.euler_characteristic], the assertion
    is triwarp's cut checked by triwarp's chi, and this group has no other oracle at all -- so chi
    is read a second time off ``trimesh.Trimesh.euler_number``, and the manifold post-conditions off
    Open3D. Both are independent implementations of the predicates, not of the repair.

    Three more properties come with it -- the result stays connected, closed and edge-manifold --
    and together they exclude the failure this function's shape invites: a cut along loops that
    cross, which shatters the surface into pieces while every individual step still looks correct
    (measured, before the disjointness rule: four spheres from a genus-2 union, and chi 8). And
    disjointness alone is not enough: on ``handles_64`` a disjoint family is *dependent*, splitting
    the slab in two while chi still rises, which is what the component assert catches and why the
    parametrization carries a genus-64 input.

    Open3D's ``is_watertight`` is **not** among them, and the reason is a measured convention rather
    than a defect on either side. It is the composition ``is_edge_manifold && is_vertex_manifold &&
    !is_self_intersecting``, and its last clause counts a *touching* pair as an intersection.
    Sealing two rims over their own vertices produces exactly that: on the torus, **97 of 1 054**
    output faces touch without crossing -- reported by ``findSelfCollidingTrianglesBS`` at
    ``touchIsIntersection=True`` and by pymeshfix's ``select_intersecting_triangles``, and reported
    as **0** by the same MeshLib call at ``touchIsIntersection=False`` and by
    [`face_self_intersecting_mask`][triwarp.validation.face_self_intersecting_mask]. So the two
    manifold clauses are asserted directly, where the two libraries agree exactly, and the third is
    left to the group that owns it.
