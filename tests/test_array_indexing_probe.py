"""
Probe: what Python-scope gather on a ``wp.array`` does with a **non-contiguous index array**.

``.claude/CLAUDE.md`` section 3.4 turns on one platform fact, and it is the kind that cannot be
found by reading: Warp's Python-scope gather ``src[indices]`` reads the index buffer *as if it were
contiguous* and silently ignores a view's stride. A column of an ``(n, 2)`` edge table, a step
slice, a reversed view -- each of those is a legal ``wp.array`` that prints correctly on its own and
gathers the wrong elements, with no exception. And the corrupt read is **faster** than the correct
one, because it touches a contiguous prefix, so neither the suite nor a benchmark catches it.

Every gather in ``triwarp/`` therefore either passes a whole array, a contiguous prefix slice, or a
buffer explicitly ``wp.clone``d out of a view -- a discipline nothing enforced until this file
existed. Section 3.4 cited it as already present; it was not, and only stale ``__pycache__``
remnants of a one-off exploratory run survived.

These are capability probes, not regression tests for triwarp code: they pin what the *platform*
does, so a future conversion can check rather than guess, and so a Warp release that fixes any of
this is noticed rather than silently relied upon. See ``.claude/CLAUDE.md`` sections 3.4 and 10.
