    Class B: VTK reaches the same seam by construction, minus the mesh's own boundary.

    pyvista has no seam filter. The route is ``extract_cells(region).extract_surface()`` followed by
    that surface's ``extract_feature_edges(boundary_edges=True)`` -- and the sub-surface's boundary
    is the seam **plus** whatever part of the mesh rim the region contains, where
    ``region_boundary_edges`` keeps only the interior half ("InsideMesh", as the MeshLib pairing
    above spells out). So the named transform is subtracting
    [`boundary_edges`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_edges], and at that it is exact. On this 6x6 grid:
    an interior region gives **12 = 12** edges with nothing on the rim, and the corner region gives
    4 against pyvista's 8, where the 4 extra are exactly the rim edges it contains. The same pair on
    a curved patch cut out of ``icosphere(3)`` reads 48 = 48 and 26 against 54 (28 on the rim), and
    on the closed sphere 44 = 44.

    Both regions are asserted here because only the second exercises the transform and only the
    first shows the two agree without it -- and the pair is what rules out the subtraction hiding a
    real disagreement.

    The remap is not optional: ``extract_feature_edges`` returns a new ``PolyData`` carrying only
    the points its lines touch, renumbered, so
    [`pyvista_edges_to_indices`][tests.conversions.pyvista_edges_to_indices] keys them back by
    position. And the fixture must not come from ``trimesh.slice_plane``: on a hemisphere built that
    way the same comparison leaves 21 edges unexplained by the transform, all of it the fragmented

    Class B: the same triangles, once all three answers are lifted into the input's numbering.

    All three libraries compact the vertex buffer -- measured on ``icosphere(2)``'s upper half,
    152 of 320 faces referencing **89** of 162 vertices, and all three return 89. What differs is
    how each one tells you the mapping back:

    | | vertices returned | how the input's numbering is recovered |
    |---|---|---|
    | triwarp | 89 | ``return_index=True`` returns the map |
    | pyvista ``extract_cells`` | 89 | ``vtkOriginalPointIds`` on the result's point data |
    | open3d ``select_faces_by_mask`` | 89 | **no map at all** -- matched by position |

    open3d's row is the one that needs care. With no map returned, its positions are matched against
    the input's vertex table by nearest neighbour, which is sound only because every kept position
    is a *copy* of an input position rather than a recomputation -- asserted as a residual below
    1e-06
    plus a bijection check. An exact key lookup would raise, since its tensor API stores ``float32``
    where the input is ``float64``.

    **The plan this came from recorded that open3d and pyvista "keep every vertex", and both
    halves were wrong** -- measured on a selection that happened to reference all of them. An
    interleaved face set does exactly that, which is why the fixture here is a **spatial** half:
    with every vertex still referenced, all three compactions are no-ops and the whole transform
    goes untested.

    **pymeshlab cannot be compared here at all, and the reason is its interface.** It has no
    array-valued face-selection setter -- a selection comes from a
    ``compute_selection_by_condition_per_face`` *expression* over face attributes, which can
    express a contiguous range (``fi<80``) and not an arbitrary index set. Asserted on the range
    form, so the limitation is pinned and the filter is exercised on the one shape it accepts.

    Non-vacuous: a strict face subset that leaves 73 vertices unreferenced, so neither an empty nor
    a whole-mesh answer would pass and every compaction is real.

    MeshLab's Erode Selection is a *face* operation and is a documented class-D exemption for the

    ``shrink`` takes a ``VertBitSet`` and erodes it by one-ring layers, which is triwarp's operation
    exactly: element-for-element agreement at every hop count here, in both directions.

    Two things about the call, both of which fail silently if got wrong. ``expand`` and ``shrink``
    are **overload sets** whose region form returns ``None`` and *mutates* the bitset in place --
    the sibling overload taking a single ``VertId`` returns a new one instead, so a call written
    against the wrong overload reads an unchanged mask rather than raising. And the region is
    built with ``mn.vertBitSetFromBools`` and read back through
    [`meshlib_bitset_to_numpy`][tests.conversions.meshlib_bitset_to_numpy], which pads it to the
    vertex domain.

    Non-vacuous in both directions: the seed grows 7 -> 19 -> 35 -> 55 vertices of 162 and the
