"""
Static scan of the public API's shape: names, summaries, file layout and module boundaries.

Each check is a defect class that was actually found rather than an aesthetic preference. They run
as an ``ast`` scan of ``triwarp/`` (excluding ``kernels/``, ``__init__.py`` and private ``_*.py``
modules) plus a listing of ``tests/`` and ``benchmarks/``, and
[`tests/test_api_conventions.py`](test_api_conventions.py) fails the default test run on any
violation. The authoritative list with its reasoning is ``.claude/CLAUDE.md`` section 4.5; what
follows is the one-line claim each check makes, so a failure message reads in context.

1. **A one-line summary says what the function returns, not which C++ call it wraps.** mkdocstrings
   renders the summary as the entry in the module's API index, so a library name there turns the
   index into a table of bindings. Attribution is wanted -- one line down, in ``Notes`` or ``See
   Also``.
2. **A ``*_mask`` producer returns a boolean array.** A function that *consumes* a mask is named
   for its input and is exempt.
3. **A module summary does not end in "(Warp)" or "on NVIDIA Warp".** The whole package is Warp.
4. **Every module has a test file and a benchmark file named for it**, and every ``test_*.py`` in
   either suite corresponds to a module. The package is flat, so the mapping is the module name.
5. **A private name stays inside its module.** A ``_helper`` imported across a module boundary is a
   function that should have been public, and the alias-on-import is the tell.
6. **Two modules do not export the same public name**, outside a written allowlist.
7. **A top-level kernel module is named for the public module it backs**, and vice versa (section
   3.1). This is what stops a wrapper from being created while its kernels stay under the old name.
8. **A private helper is defined below its first caller** (section 5's stepdown rule), so a reader
   never jumps backward to a definition they have not met.
9. **A Warp-version claim names a version at least as new as the installed ``warp-lang``.** It also
   scans ``kernels/``, ``tests/`` and ``benchmarks/``, because a stale ``pytest.skip`` is worse than
   a stale comment: the comment misinforms, the skip silently deletes coverage, and on a box with
   CUDA the deleted branch is the one nobody runs. It abstains on ``.md``.
10. **A Python-scope allocation names the device it allocates on.** Without ``device=`` a buffer
    lands on Warp's *current* device rather than the device of the arrays it is about to be used
    with. The suite never catches it, because a test runs with its arrays' device current and the
    omission then resolves correctly by accident.
11. **A public function that raises documents a ``Raises`` block.** Only a *direct* ``raise`` in the
    function's own body counts; the many functions delegating validation to a shared guard are
    correct and are not scanned.
12. **A fenced ``python`` docstring example runs.** The odd member of the family: the scan only
    *extracts* the blocks and [`tests/test_api_conventions.py`](test_api_conventions.py) executes
    them against a mesh fixture, because an example's defect is a runtime one that ``ast.parse``
    cannot see.
13. **A kernel output argument is named ``out_*`` and sits at the end of the signature** (section
    2.1). Two argument classes are exempt and carried in ``_KERNEL_OUTPUT_ALLOWLIST``: in-place
    arguments, and scratch / persistent-state buffers.
14. **An array annotation is subscript-style** -- ``wp.array[T]``, not ``wp.array(dtype=T)``
    (section 1.2). Restricted to *annotation* positions, which is what lets it scan the whole
    package: ``wp.array(dtype=T)`` is a legal allocation at Python scope.
15. **A ``wp.launch`` / ``wp.launch_tiled`` names the device it launches on.** The memory-safety
    guard of the family: an omitted ``device=`` runs a kernel on ``cuda:0`` over host pointers,
    returns the right answer, and corrupts the heap when those arrays are freed mid-kernel. This is
    the half that carries the load -- ``conftest.py``'s ``STRICT`` mode only bites when the arrays
    are *not* on the launch device, so on a CUDA run the omission is invisible to it.
16. **A cast inside a kernel is spelled ``wp.int32`` / ``wp.float32``, never bare ``int`` /
    ``float``** (section 1.3). Same builtins under a different name, with one asymmetry that
    matters: ``float(...)`` is a *hard compile error* inside a ``wp.Float``-generic function, so it
    silently forecloses genericising that function.
17. **An integer division inside a kernel is spelled ``//``, never ``/``** (section 1.5). On
    integers the two are the *same* operation in Warp, so this is legibility: ``/`` on two
    ``int32``s reads as real division and truncates only because the operands happen to be integers.
    It types an operand only *by declaration*, which is what makes it safe on float-heavy code.
18. **A kernel-scope argument or return is annotated in Warp's types** (section 1.2). It reads
    ``@wp.kernel`` / ``@wp.func`` signatures only, because a kernel *factory* is ordinary Python
    whose ``int`` parameters are correct.
19. **A test comparing against a reference library says which class the comparison is** (section
    7.4). It accepts all four label phrases the suite uses, keys on ``ast.Assert`` so a fixture
    unpack is not a hit, and leaves ``_np`` out because it marks inputs as often as oracles. It
    checks that a label is *present*, never that it is the right one.
20. **A conditional value in kernel scope is ``wp.where``, not a Python ternary** (section 1.5).
21. **Nothing under ``triwarp/`` names MeshLib or promesh** -- a licensing guard (section 7.6).
22. **A single-index ``wp.tid()`` is cast** (section 1.3).
23. **A ``@wp.func`` reached by ``wp.map`` from several call sites has a declaration table**
    (section 3.5).
24. **A ``.claude/CLAUDE.md`` cross-reference names a section that exists**, and names a
    *subsection* wherever the chapter has any. The second half is the point: a bare chapter number
    still *resolves*, which is exactly what a resolving check cannot see. Chapters with no
    subsection are accepted bare, read from the heading structure rather than a list.
25. **No ``!!!`` admonition sits inside a numpydoc item-list section** (section 6). griffe reads
    each entry's first line as a name, so an admonition header between two ``Raises`` entries
    renders as an exception type.
26. **A Warp-typed module constant is not used as a Python-scope arithmetic operand or slice
    bound** (section 4.5). Its operators route through Warp's builtin dispatch.

Why a static scan rather than importing ``triwarp``
---------------------------------------------------
Importing would make the verdict depend on Warp's module cache and on which optional dependencies
resolve, and would say nothing about files (checks 4 and 7) at all. A scan reads the tree as
written, so its answer is the same in every environment and every pytest invocation. Check 9 needs
the installed Warp version and takes it from ``importlib.metadata`` rather than
``warp.config.version``, so even that one imports nothing. Check 12 is the single exception,
deliberately: an example's defect is a *runtime* one, so nothing short of running it finds it, and
the extraction half stays here so the execution half has no parsing to do.

# Private helpers that sit above their first caller today. CLAUDE.md section 5 says a helper must

# before the check existed -- 49 sites across 15 modules, carried here as an explicit debt list
# rather than a silent exemption. That list has now been drained: one entry remains, and it is not
# debt but a permanent structural exemption. **Entries come out, they do not go in** -- a new helper
# must be placed correctly, which is what this check enforces.
#
# Two things the sweep learned, both of which the check itself caught:
#
# - Reordering has to consider *every* private helper in a module, not only the flagged ones.
#   Moving a flagged helper below a callee it uses strands that callee: ``holes._loop_perimeters``
#   was compliant before, because its caller sat above it, and became a fresh violation.
# - A name can appear several times at module scope, since ``@overload`` stubs precede their
#   implementation. Verifying a "pure move" by comparing functions keyed on name silently collapses
#   those duplicates, so the check on the *reorder* has to compare the multiset.
# --- check 9 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Warp version claim, and the spelling is the convention: the word **Warp** immediately before

    only because the operands happen to be integers, which means a reader has to recover both types

    Why a check rather than a one-off edit: the third pass converted eight sites and wrote the rule

# Two libraries the shipped package may not cite, in one pattern because the fix is the same for
# both: say what the code computes, or name the algorithm in the literature's vocabulary. Their
# *reasons* differ and are worth keeping apart -- MeshLib first, then promesh below.
#
# MeshLib's licence restricts *use*, not merely distribution of derivatives, and triwarp ships
# ``MIT OR Apache-2.0`` -- so ``.claude/CLAUDE.md``'s MeshLib block requires that nothing under
# ``triwarp/`` name the library at all: not the library, not one of its C++ functions, not one of
# its source files. This is the pattern that sentence's grep asks for, widened in two ways the
# eighth kernels pass measured as necessary. The ``MR`` prefix covers a source-file or class name
# generically (the block's own list of four symbols matched *none* of the three file-name comments
# found in ``kernels/``, because they name ``MRLaplacian.cpp`` and
# ``MRPointCloudTriangulationHelpers.cpp``); the named C++ identifiers cover the two comments that
# said "port of" in the imperative, which is the sharper half of the defect and carries no ``MR``.
# Prose mentions in ``tests/`` and ``benchmarks/`` are correct and required -- a comparison has to
# say what it compares against -- so the scan is scoped to the package.
#
# ``promesh`` is here for a *related but distinct* reason, and the difference is worth stating so
# the next reader does not merge the two rules. It is not proprietary -- it is
# **unverifiable**: ``reference/promesh/`` is a bare source drop with no ``LICENSE``, no
# ``COPYING`` and no ``pyproject.toml``, so its terms cannot be read from this repo at all, and it
# is not a published package (nothing installs it, so it can never be a comparison row either).
# Five references had accumulated in ``holes.py``, two of them claiming a *port* ("the Warp port
# of promesh's ``triangulate_boundaries``", "Mirrors promesh's private helper") -- a derivation
# claim against terms nobody here has checked, which is the same hazard as the MeshLib half even
# though the licence story is the opposite. All five were rewritten into the algorithm's own
# vocabulary (Barequet & Sharir's gap bridging, the minimal-perimeter heuristic, the

    Check 25: a ``!!!`` admonition inside a numpydoc *item-list* section.

    griffe parses a numpydoc section by reading each entry's first line as a name -- a parameter
    name, an exception type -- so an ``!!! note "..."`` header sitting between two entries of a
    ``Raises`` block becomes an **exception type** on the rendered API page, and the admonition's
    own body is swallowed as that exception's description. The page grows a row for a type that
    does not exist and the warning the author wrote never renders as one. Nothing else sees it:
    ``zensical build --strict`` is clean, because every cross-reference in the swallowed text still
    resolves, and ruff's ``D`` rules do not model section contents.

    It had decayed to **eight** sites across six modules before anyone looked, six of them in the
    ``Raises`` block of a function whose caveat is genuinely worth reading -- which is the tell
    that this is a convention people get wrong rather than a rule they flout: an admonition is
    written where the thought occurs, and the thought occurs while documenting what the function
    rejects.

    **It ships with no allowlist, deliberately.** Unlike the section-number check above there is no
    legitimate instance to exempt: an item-list section is a list of items, and every admonition
    has a correct home one section down (``Notes``) or in the leading description, with no loss of
    meaning and no reordering of anything a caller reads first. An allowlist here would only ever
    hold a site nobody had moved yet.

    Scans every module under ``triwarp/``, ``kernels/`` included. Nothing in ``kernels/`` renders,
    so a hit there is cosmetic rather than a broken page -- but the convention is the same one, the
    scan is the same scan, and a rule that holds in one half of the tree and not the other is a
    rule the next reader has to look up.

    **What it deliberately does not catch is the general case, which is any free prose between two
    entries** -- a plain sentence appended to a ``Returns`` block becomes a third, *nameless*
    return, confirmed the same way. Only the ``!!!`` form is scanned, because separating stray
    prose from an entry's own indented continuation needs the indentation rules numpydoc itself is
    loose about, and a check that guesses there would misfire on correct docstrings. The admonition
    form is the one that decayed, and it is unambiguous.

    Check 26: a Warp-typed constant used in Python-scope arithmetic or as a slice bound.

    A ``wp.int32`` / ``wp.float32`` / ``wp.vec3`` instance is not a Python number. Its ``__add__``
    and friends are ``warp._src.types.scalar_base``'s, which call ``warp.add(self, y)`` -- Warp's
    Python-scope builtin dispatch, an ``inspect.signature().bind()`` per operand -- **two to three
    orders of magnitude a Python float's operator**. A ``wp.array`` slice taken with such bounds is
    worse still, because ``wp.array.__getitem__`` forms ``stop - start`` and ``strides * start``
    internally, so one Warp-typed bound is three dispatches rather than one.

    The defect is silent, which is why it needs a scan: the answer is correct, the compiler sees
    nothing, and the suite sees nothing. Its siblings are not -- ``//`` and ``%`` on a Warp scalar
    raise ``TypeError``, and ``wp.zeros(wp.int32(n))`` raises too -- so arithmetic and slicing are
    the whole of the hazard.

    **Scope is deliberately narrow.** Uses are read in the wrapper layer (``triwarp/*.py``, which
    holds no kernel bodies at all) and at *module scope* in ``kernels/``; a kernel or ``@wp.func``
    body is where these constants are supposed to be used and is never read. The check also stops
    at constants: extending it to ``wp.length`` / ``wp.cross`` calls would flag mostly legitimate
    sites, which is how a check gets switched off.
