    The axis-aligned bounding box against all four references: Class A on three, Class B on igl.

    Trivial to compute and trivial to get subtly wrong -- a reduction that seeds its accumulator at
    zero rather than at +/-inf returns a box clamped to the origin, which is correct for any mesh
    straddling it and wrong for every mesh that does not. Every fixture here is translated away from
    the origin, so that bug would show.

    The benchmark's trimesh row is the uncached ``vstack((v.min(0), v.max(0)))`` formula behind
    ``Trimesh.bounds`` rather than the cached property, and that formula is what is compared here.

    **igl returns the box as geometry, not as two corners.** ``igl.bounding_box(V)`` gives the
    ``2**3 = 8`` corner *vertices* plus the 12 triangles of the box hull, so the named transform is
    to reduce those 8 corners back to a min/max pair. That is a genuinely different output shape for
    the same answer, and reducing it is exact.

    MeshLib's ``computeBoundingBox`` is Class A and returns a ``Box3f`` -- ``.min`` / ``.max``, the
    two corners directly. Its ``region`` argument is passed ``None`` for the whole mesh; note that
    it takes the *topology* as well as the points, so on a mesh with unreferenced vertices it would
    box only the referenced ones, where triwarp's takes the point buffer alone. Every fixture here
    references every vertex, so the two coincide.
