"""
Comparison helpers for parity tests, where the two sides agree only up to a known transform.

Kept separate from [`tests/conversions.py`](conversions.py) because these are not format
conversions: each one encodes a *reason* why two correct implementations disagree elementwise --
ordering, winding, sign, gauge, or the absence of any correspondence at all -- and that reasoning
should have one home rather than being re-derived per module.

The classes of comparison, and the bar each has to clear (see CLAUDE.md section 7.4):

- **A** direct ``np.allclose`` / ``np.array_equal``. No helper needed.
- **B** equal after a named transform, at full ``1e-5`` tolerance. Most helpers here are class B:
  the transform is exact, so loosening the tolerance to accommodate it means the transform was
  wrong.
- **C** a derived scalar or set distance, because no correspondence between the two answers exists.
  [`symmetric_surface_distance`][tests.comparisons.symmetric_surface_distance],
  [`symmetric_chamfer`][tests.comparisons.symmetric_chamfer],
  [`chamfer_two_sided`][tests.comparisons.chamfer_two_sided],
  [`hausdorff_two_sided`][tests.comparisons.hausdorff_two_sided] and
  [`fraction_within`][tests.comparisons.fraction_within] are the class-C machinery. A class-C assert
  must name the bug class it excludes and record its measured margin in the test docstring -- a
  threshold sitting at the measured value is a latent flake *and* a weak test.

!!! warning
    ``fraction_within(a, b, ...) > f`` is the easiest of these to make vacuous, because a fraction
    computed over marginal distributions is invariant to shuffling one side. Before trusting one,
    check that shuffling ``b`` makes it fail.

    0.228) -- one stray sample in a tail dominates the max and swamps the signal.

    Two-sided Hausdorff distance between two point sets -- the worst-case counterpart to chamfer.

    Where [`symmetric_chamfer`][tests.comparisons.symmetric_chamfer] averages and so tolerates a few
    stray elements, this reports the single worst one. Use it when the claim is "no part of either
    answer is far from the other", e.g. comparing intersection curves or sliced boundaries.

    Goes through a ``cKDTree`` rather than a dense ``(n, m)`` distance matrix. That is the same
    answer at a fraction of the memory, and it is why the private copy it replaced in
    ``tests/test_intersection.py`` is gone: two curve samples of a few thousand points each is an
    eight-figure matrix for one scalar.

    """
    Worst-case two-sided distance between two mesh *surfaces*, via surface sampling.

    The claim is "no part of either surface is far from the other" -- the statement a remeshing or
    decimation test wants, where the output has a different vertex count, a different triangulation
    and no correspondence at all with its input, so only a set distance can be asserted.

    Distinct from [`hausdorff_two_sided`][tests.comparisons.hausdorff_two_sided] despite the name:
    that one is point-set to point-set and this one measures each sample against the other mesh's
    surface, so a coarse triangulation is not penalised for having few vertices. It is the
    worst-case half of
    [`symmetric_surface_distance`][tests.comparisons.symmetric_surface_distance], kept separate
    because it queries through ``trimesh.proximity.signed_distance`` and the thresholds in
    ``tests/test_remesh.py`` are calibrated against these exact numbers.

    !!! warning "``signed_distance`` wants a closed mesh"
        The sign comes from a containment test, so on an open surface the magnitude is still the
        distance but the query is doing more work than it needs to. Prefer
        [`symmetric_surface_distance`][tests.comparisons.symmetric_surface_distance] for a new
        comparison on open input.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices_a, faces_a, vertices_b, faces_b
        The two meshes, as ``(n, 3)`` positions and ``(n_faces, 3)`` indices. Arrays rather than
        ``tm.Trimesh`` because every caller holds a raw pair straight out of triwarp, igl, open3d or
        pymeshlab, and building a mesh at each call site would be noise.
    n_samples
        Area-uniform samples drawn per mesh, at fixed seeds so the result is reproducible.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The larger of the two one-sided worst-case distances.
