    Class C: five blue-noise samplers, five algorithms, no correspondence between the point sets.

    triwarp reduces a dense pool by randomized priority (flat background grid), Open3D's
    ``sample_points_poisson_disk`` runs Yuksel's sample *elimination* from a dense uniform cloud,
    MeshLab's ``generate_sampling_poisson_disk`` is Corsini's hierarchical dart throwing, and
    ``igl.blue_noise`` is Bridson active-list dart throwing -- which is what triwarp itself ran
    until the algorithm was replaced, and whose ``30x`` pool oversampling triwarp still uses; and
    **meshlib's ``pointUniformSampling`` subsamples a point cloud** rather than a surface, so it is
    the one reference here that has to be given triwarp's own dense pool as its input -- which makes
    its row the cleanest algorithm-against-algorithm reading of the five, since the pool is
    identical.
    Nothing about the individual samples is shared -- not their count, not their positions, not even
    their number given the same parameter -- so the comparison is on the properties all four claim.
    MeshLab and igl both accept a *radius* (``radius=PureValue(r)`` overrides ``samplenum``; igl's
    third argument is ``r``), so they get triwarp's own parameter; Open3D takes a count and gets
    triwarp's output count, exactly as the benchmark parametrizes them.

    **Bug class excluded:** a sampler that is not blue noise at all (assert 1) and one that is blue
    noise over only part of the surface (asserts 2 and 3). Both are live failure modes for a
    grid-based dart thrower -- a mis-sized background cell rejects too little, a mis-mapped cell-to-
    face seeding covers too little -- and neither is visible to
    ``test_sample_surface_blue_noise_min_distance``, which tests triwarp against itself.

    **Measured, with both mutation probes.** Two degenerate stand-ins are scored alongside: a
    uniform Monte-Carlo cloud of the *same size* (blue noise's null hypothesis) and one confined to
    4 of the 20 faces.

    | | closest pair / r | worst gap / r | faces hit |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | triwarp | 1.000 | 1.064 | 20 / 20 |
    | igl, same radius | 1.000 | 1.073 | 20 / 20 |
    | MeshLab, same radius | 1.000 | 1.112 | 20 / 20 |
    | meshlib, same radius and pool | 1.000 | **0.982** | 20 / 20 |
    | Open3D, same count | 0.926 | 1.197 | 20 / 20 |
    | uniform Monte Carlo | **0.005** | 1.878 | 20 / 20 |
    | one patch | **0.005** | **17.781** | **4 / 20** |

    So assert 1 (``>= 0.85``) clears the worst reference by 8% and both probes by **200x** -- it is
    the assert carrying the bug class. Assert 3 (every face hit) separates the clumped probe by a
    factor of 5. Assert 2 (worst gap ``<= 1.4``) is the weakest of the three at a 1.34x margin
    over the Monte-Carlo probe, and it is applied to triwarp, igl and MeshLab -- the three that
    received the identical radius. Open3D is exempt from it: its elimination sampler genuinely
    leaves larger gaps on a 20-face mesh, a property of its algorithm rather than a disagreement.

    igl is the **closest of the three in output** and the only one that beats triwarp on a column:
    747 samples against triwarp's 749 (0.3% apart, against MeshLab's 769) and the tightest coverage
    of the four at 1.073 r. That is worth stating next to the benchmark, where triwarp is 4-24x
    faster than it -- the port is not buying its speed with quality.

    triwarp's ``1.000`` in the first column is **exact rather than tolerant**, and is a property of
    the algorithm rather than of this fixture: an accepted point is never within ``r`` of another
    accepted one, because the later of any such pair would already have been discarded by the
    earlier one's ball. The two ``0.005`` probe rows are what the column looks like without that.
