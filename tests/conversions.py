    Upload a NumPy mesh as triwarp's ``(wp.array[wp.vec3], flat wp.array[wp.int32])`` pair.

    The single most duplicated helper in this suite: six private copies across six modules and 54
    call sites, differing only in where the ``float32`` cast sat. It is separate from
    [`trimesh_to_warp`][tests.conversions.trimesh_to_warp], which returns a ``wp.Mesh`` (a BVH

    Positions land as **float32**: that is what ``wp.vec3`` holds, and it is the reason a comparison

    ----------
    vertices_np
        ``(n, 3)`` positions, any float dtype.
    faces_np

    Two mechanical points. ``bitorder="little"`` is not optional: the block's bit *i* is index
    ``i``, which is NumPy's non-default order. And ``fromBlocks`` rejects a NumPy ``uint64`` array
    with ``TypeError`` -- the bound argument is ``std_vector_unsigned_long``, which accepts a Python
    list -- then rounds the size up to whole 64-bit blocks, so the ``resize`` trims the padding back
    to the caller's domain.

    ``flags_np`` must already be flattened in the target element's own order; for a

    !!! warning "``load_array`` is not a load; it is already a repair, and it renumbers"
        It runs the kernel's connectivity fix and Euler update before returning, so the mesh that
        comes back is not the mesh that went in. Measured on a 42-vertex / 80-face icosphere: a
        trailing *or* interior unreferenced vertex is dropped (43 -> 42, surviving positions and
        their relative order intact); an exactly duplicated face is **kept** and the non-manifold
        edges it creates are cut instead (80 f -> 81 f, 42 v -> **45 v**), while a *reversed*
        duplicate is refused and the vertices are still cut; two coincident referenced vertices are
        **not** merged; one backwards face is rewound, and *every* face backwards is left alone,
        because consistent is not the same as outward (volume -3.6587 in and out).

        On the scan meshes: ``bunny_decimated`` 8 171 v / 16 301 f loads as **8 372 v / 16 220 f**

        ``boy`` 1 483 v -> 1 559 v at an unchanged 2 964 faces -- which leaves two coincident sheets
        where the surface had one.

        So **every comparison against this reference must be index-free**: positions, canonically
        sorted face rows, sets and counts. Where a face index is unavoidable, assert the load
        changed nothing first (``n_points == len(v) and n_faces == len(f)``) and build the map from
        the *returned* buffer -- which is what
        [`pymeshfix_intersecting_faces`][tests.conversions.pymeshfix_intersecting_faces] does.

    One ``PyTMesh`` serves **one load and one mutating call**: a second ``load_array`` raises
    ``RuntimeError``, and every algorithm mutates in place and returns a status, a count or an
    array rather than the mesh. So this returns a fresh object every call and there is no cached
