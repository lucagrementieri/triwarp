    ``fix_self_intersections`` is verified by -- so a shared bug here would pass three tests in two
    files.

    ``compute_selection_by_self_intersections_per_face`` writes the selection onto
    ``current_mesh()`` and ``face_selection_array()`` reads it back as a bool array, which needs no
    transform at all and matches triwarp's mask **exactly on all three inputs**.
    ``get_self_intersecting_triangles`` returns colliding **pairs**, so ``np.unique`` over them is
    the named transform.

    Measured, faces flagged of the input's total:

    is between axis-aligned triangles with parallel edges, which a separating-axis narrow phase gets
    wrong and an interval test does not. So open3d's answer is asserted as a strict **subset** on
    that input and as an equality on the other two -- and a future open3d that found all 12 would
    fail here, which is the point of pinning it.

    Worth knowing before generalising: **MeshLib gets these boxes right** (12) although its
    *two-mesh* entry point gets the equivalent pair wrong (5 and 4 of 6 and 6). The single-mesh and
    two-mesh paths are different code, so a divergence measured on one says nothing about the other.

    returned nothing would fail rather than agree.

    Two earlier readings of this test were wrong, which is why the history is kept. It first said
    205 against 161 and called it two separating-axis implementations classifying a band
    differently; arbitration showed 42 of those 45 extra faces were **false positives** from a
    degenerate SAT axis. It then recorded 160 against 161 and called the remaining gap genuine
    float32 tangency; running the same interval test in ``float64`` closed it. What is left is a
    2-face disagreement that no longer favours the reference.

    The bound stays at **0.5 %** of the faces, which is what makes this a regression test: either
    defect would take it back over 1 %.

    Class B (compare detection): ``findOverlappingTris`` under the named angle-to-dot transform.

    MeshLib parameterizes a fold by the **dot product** of the two normals where triwarp takes the

    default of ``-0.99`` is 171.9 degrees, not triwarp's 160. Fed that, the two agree face for face

    ``findNotSmoothFaces`` is **not** the pairing, and that was measured: it reports **zero** faces
    on this fan at every ``minAngle`` from 0.1 to 3.0 radians, so a comparison built on it would
    pass vacuously against any implementation.

    Two conventions the fan is shaped around. MeshLib is **inclusive at the threshold** where
    triwarp is exclusive -- a pair at exactly 140 degrees is flagged by MeshLib and not by triwarp
    at ``angle=140`` -- so no fixture angle sits on a threshold used here. And MeshLib's criterion
    is *proximity plus antiparallel normals*, not adjacency: on the three-face
    ``folded_patch`` it flags all three faces because the folded apex triangle lies over both quad
    halves, where triwarp flags only the one face whose dihedral exceeds the threshold. That
