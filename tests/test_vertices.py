    which is read off ``compute_cell_sizes`` on the same mesh rather than recomputed. Measured

    relative tolerance is meaningless there. The residual is triwarp's ``float32`` vertex buffer and
    not the reference's -- pyvista's curvature comes back float64, and the same comparison against
    vedo's float32 points measures the same 5e-05 on a larger mesh.
