"""
Open and closed 3D polyline operations.

**The ``polyline_`` prefix.** Where a name carries the module's own token, the token comes
**first** -- ``polyline_length``, ``polyline_open``, ``polyline_resample``,
``polyline_triangulate`` -- so the whole family sorts and completes together.

A function that does *not* need the token does not gain one:
[`is_closed`][triwarp.polyline.is_closed] and
[`cumulative_arc_length`][triwarp.polyline.cumulative_arc_length] have an unambiguous subject
already, and [`triangulate_polygon`][triwarp.polyline.triangulate_polygon] takes a 2D polygon
rather than a polyline, so the token there would be wrong rather than redundant.
[`polyline_point_distance`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_point_distance] keeps both nouns because the
prefix alone would lose "from what"; it is spelled to match
[`points.point_plane_distance`][triwarp.points.point_plane_distance].

**The ``closed=`` convention.** Ten of these functions -- length, centroid, radius, angles,
point-to-curve distance, and the five resampling operations -- take a keyword-only
``closed: bool = False``. Passing ``closed=True`` appends the closing edge back to the first point
if it is absent ([`polyline_close`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_close]) and then does the open
computation on that, so the seam is treated like any other segment. Three of the ten additionally
drop the duplicated seam point on the way out, so their result is a clean cyclic ring with one entry
per *original* point rather than one extra:
[`polyline_resample`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_resample],
[`polyline_angles`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_angles] and
[`polyline_smooth_upsample`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_smooth_upsample].

The keyword is not always needed. [`polyline_angles`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_angles] and
[`polyline_smooth_upsample`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_smooth_upsample] already detect an
*explicitly* closed input -- one whose last point equals its first -- with
[`is_closed`][triwarp.polyline.is_closed]; ``closed=True`` is for the common case of a loop stored
without that duplicate, which is the form
[`boundary_loops`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops] returns.

    Like [`polyline_upsample`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_upsample], each segment is split into

    The first and last segments of an open polyline have no bracketing neighbour and are subdivided

    """

    Simplify a polyline with the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm.

    Drops interior vertices whose perpendicular distance to the chord spanning a kept sub-range is
    at most ``tol``; the first and last vertices are always retained. The recursion is evaluated
    **level-synchronously** rather than depth-first -- one round of every point in parallel per
    level of the split tree, so the cost is the tree's *depth* (about ``log2(n)`` on a mesh
    boundary loop) rather than one thread's walk of the whole tree. The accepted set is identical
    either way, since breadth-first and depth-first evaluation of the same recursion accept the
    same points.


    Parameters
    ----------
    polyline
        ``(n,)`` polyline vertices as ``wp.vec3``.
    tol
        Maximum Euclidean distance allowed between a dropped vertex and the retained chord.
    closed
        When ``True``, treat the polyline as a loop: the closing edge back to the first point is
        added if absent (see [`polyline_close`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_close]). ``indices``
        then refer to the *closed* polyline, so the shared start/end vertex is preserved at both
        ends.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[wp.array[wp.vec3], wp.array[wp.int32]]
        ``(simplified, indices)`` on ``polyline.device``: the ``(m,)`` retained vertices and the
        ``(m,)`` sorted indices into the input such that ``polyline[indices] == simplified``. An
        empty input yields two empty arrays; a single point is returned unchanged with
        ``indices == [0]``.

    Notes
    -----
    The round loop runs **on device** with no readback. Up to a few thousand points on CUDA, and at
    every size on the CPU device, it runs as a single block whose lanes share the points, with a
    block barrier between the steps of a round; a longer polyline on CUDA drives the four launches
    with ``wp.capture_while`` exactly as
    [`polyline_triangulate`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_triangulate]'s ear rounds are driven. Both
    forms run the same per-point steps and accept the same points. The one host synchronisation in
    the call is the compaction that follows the loop, where
    [`flatnonzero`][triwarp.array.flatnonzero] reads back the kept count in order to size
    ``indices``.

    **The depth is bounded by the accepted count, not by ``n``, and that is why there is no round
    cap and no serial fallback here.** Every root-to-leaf path of the split tree accepts one point
    per level, so ``rounds <= kept + 1`` -- a deep tree is precisely an input that accepts most of
    its points, which is also the input the recursion does the most work on. A spiral's depth tracks
    its *turn count* rather than ``n``, while a power curve, a geometric staircase and a decaying
    sawtooth are all shallower than a boundary loop.

    Radius of a polyline projected onto the plane through ``center`` with the given ``normal``.

    inner radius (nearest point, not vertex, on the polyline).

    Parameters
    ----------
    polyline
        ``(n,)`` polyline vertices as ``wp.vec3``.
    reduction
        Reduction over the per-segment radial distances: ``"min"``, ``"max"``, ``"mean"``, or

    center
        Plane origin. Defaults to [`polyline_centroid`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_centroid].
    normal
        Plane normal (need not be unit). Defaults to
        [`polyline_normal`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_normal].

        These two are the circle's frame, not a cutting plane, so they deliberately keep their own
        names and their own order rather than the ``(plane_normal, plane_origin)`` convention every
        plane argument in the package follows -- both are keyword-defaulted here, and calling them
        a plane would misdescribe the geometry.
    closed
        When ``True``, treat the polyline as a loop: the closing edge back to the first point is
        added if absent (see [`polyline_close`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_close]), so the closing
        segment contributes a radial distance like any other, and the default ``center`` /

    float

    The polyline is treated as the boundary of a simple polygon, which is filled with triangles

    simple ``n``-gon yields ``n - 2`` non-overlapping triangles that cover the polygon. The loop is

    until the polygon is exhausted. Returned faces are consistently wound counter-clockwise with
    respect to the loop's turning direction; the exact set of triangles may differ from a sequential
    ear clip, but every triangulation of a simple polygon has ``n - 2`` faces.

    The cost is set by the **round count**, and the round count by how many ears the
    independent-set rule can retire at once. Competing ears are ranked by a bijective hash of their
    ring index rather than by the index itself, which is what keeps that logarithmic: under the raw
    index an alternating star lets the ear at ``i - 2`` suppress the ear at ``i`` for every ``i``,
    so one ear is clipped per round and the loop runs its full ``n``-round cap.

    Parameters
    ----------
    polyline
        ``(n,)`` polyline vertices as ``wp.vec3``. A duplicated closing point is dropped, with the
        predicate [`polyline_open`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_open] applies.

    Returns
    -------
    twt.Array2dInt32
        ``(m, 3)`` triangle vertex indices into ``polyline`` on ``polyline.device``. ``m`` is
        ``n - 2`` for a simple polygon; a degenerate or self-intersecting loop may yield fewer
        (a partial triangulation). Empty ``(0, 3)`` for fewer than three points.

    Notes
    -----
    The whole clip runs **on device**. A short ring is clipped by a single block that runs every
    round itself; a long one, whose rounds fill the device, by a round loop driven by
    ``wp.capture_while`` over a device-side condition. On the CPU device the single-block form is
    used at every length. Two readbacks are left in the whole function, both structural: one
    carrying the ring length (whether the last point repeats the first), the loop's orientation and
    its reflex count, which together decide every launch dimension and the convex fan fast path; and
    the face count, which sizes the returned slice. The plane frame is accumulated and consumed on
    the device and never crosses to the host.

    Every path produces the same triangulation up to row order, and that row order is not stable on
    CUDA -- faces are appended through an atomic counter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    polygon
        ``(n,)`` 2D ring vertices, in order. A repeated closing point is dropped.

    Returns
    -------
    ring : wp.array[wp.vec2]

    Notes
    -----
    Differs from [`trimesh.creation.triangulate_polygon`][] in three ways, all of which follow from
    replacing the CPU polygon libraries (``mapbox_earcut`` / ``manifold3d`` / ``triangle``) with
    triwarp's own GPU ear clipper, [`polyline_triangulate`][triwarp.polyline.polyline_triangulate]:

    - The input is a ``wp.vec2`` ring, not a ``shapely.geometry.Polygon``, and **interior rings
      (holes) are not supported**.
    - No Steiner points are ever inserted, which is trimesh's ``force_vertices=True`` contract
      rather than its default.
    - There is no ``engine`` selection, and ``faces`` is flat rather than ``(m, 3)``, matching the
      face layout used throughout triwarp.

    The ring must be a simple (non self-intersecting) polygon. A degenerate ring yields a partial
    triangulation with fewer than ``n - 2`` triangles rather than raising.
