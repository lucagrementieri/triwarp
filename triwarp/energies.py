"""
Energies over a mesh: the scalar regularizers, and the operators the solvers minimize.

The line between this module and [`triwarp.laplacian`][triwarp.laplacian] is *order*: laplacian
builds the first-order operators -- the cotangent stiffness matrix, its mass matrix and the
intrinsic repairs that keep them finite -- and everything here is assembled out of those.

Four families, and the first is the only one that returns a number rather than a matrix:

- **Scalar mesh regularizers.** [`edge_length_loss`][triwarp.energies.edge_length_loss],
  [`normal_consistency_loss`][triwarp.energies.normal_consistency_loss] and
  [`laplacian_smoothing_loss`][triwarp.energies.laplacian_smoothing_loss] are the priors a mesh
  *optimization* adds to a data term -- one per edge length, one per dihedral angle and one per
  vertex Laplacian residual, each reduced to a single ``float``. They are here rather than in
  [`triwarp.metrics`][triwarp.metrics], which hosts the data terms they pair with, because their
  machinery is this module's: ``laplacian_smoothing_loss``'s two cotangent variants consume
  [`cotmatrix`][triwarp.laplacian.cotmatrix] and
  [`mass_matrix_entries`][triwarp.laplacian.mass_matrix_entries], which is exactly the import set
  the quadratic forms below use.

- **Smoothness energies over vertices.** [`k_harmonic`][triwarp.energies.k_harmonic] is the
  integrated ``k``-harmonic form -- ``k = 1`` is Dirichlet, ``k = 2`` the biharmonic operator behind
  smooth interpolation -- and it distorts a field near the boundary, because clamping a biharmonic
  solve there is not a natural condition. [`hessian_energy`][triwarp.energies.hessian_energy] and
  [`curved_hessian_energy`][triwarp.energies.curved_hessian_energy] are the alternatives that do
  not: both integrate a squared Hessian instead, so linear (respectively, locally linear)
  functions sit exactly in the null space, boundary or not.
- **The edge-based Crouzeix-Raviart pair.**
  [`crouzeix_raviart_cotmatrix`][triwarp.energies.crouzeix_raviart_cotmatrix] and
  [`crouzeix_raviart_massmatrix`][triwarp.energies.crouzeix_raviart_massmatrix] put the degrees of
  freedom on edge midpoints rather than vertices, which is the nonconforming-FEM discretization
  ``curved_hessian_energy`` is built on. They are the siblings of
  [`cotmatrix`][triwarp.laplacian.cotmatrix] and [`mass_matrix`][triwarp.laplacian.mass_matrix] --
  a reader arriving from libigl, where all four sit together, should start there.
- **The LSCM operator.** [`lscm_hessian`][triwarp.energies.lscm_hessian] is the
  ``(2n, 2n)`` form behind the least-squares conformal map, and
  [`vector_area_matrix`][triwarp.energies.vector_area_matrix] is the boundary term that couples its
  two coordinate blocks. [`lscm`][triwarp.parametrization.lscm] is the solve; these are what it
  minimizes.

Every *operator* is assembled in ``float64`` in a single ``bsr_from_triplets``, because the
conjugate-gradient solves they feed run in ``float64`` for determinism and a ``float32``
intermediate would be the accuracy floor. The three scalar regularizers are ``float32`` throughout:
they are read by a human or by an optimizer's stopping rule, not solved with.

    Mean squared deviation of the undirected edge lengths from a resting length.

    The edge regularizer of the deformation losses: ``mean((||e|| - L0)^2)`` over the **unique
    undirected** edges, so an interior edge counts once rather than twice. At the default
    ``target_length = 0.0`` it is the mean squared edge length, which is what a shrinking prior
    wants; a positive value pulls the mesh toward uniform edges of that size instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.

    Mean magnitude of a Laplacian residual per vertex, under one of three normalizations.

      ([`laplacian`][triwarp.laplacian.laplacian] with ``equal_weight=True``) -- the umbrella
      residual, which is a *length* and therefore scales with the mesh.
    - ``"cot"``: the same residual against the **cotangent-weighted** neighbour average,
      ``|| (L v)_i / s_i ||`` with ``L`` the cotangent stiffness matrix and ``s_i`` its
      off-diagonal row sum. Also a length, and the geometry-aware version of the above.
    - ``"cotcurv"``: ``|| (L v)_i / (6 M_ii) ||`` with ``M`` the barycentric lumped mass -- the mean
      curvature magnitude, so it carries units of one over length and is the largest of the three
      on a unit-scale mesh.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` positions.
    faces

    method

    comparable at all: the
    reference's ``cot`` and ``cotcurv`` read a cotangent Laplacian whose off-diagonal is **twice**
    triwarp's half-cotangent table and whose diagonal is identically zero, which cancels out of
    both ratios above -- and where a vertex's row sum is not positive its averaging is undefined,

    """
    Integrated k-harmonic operator ``Q = (-L) (M^-1 (-L))^(k-1)`` from a Laplacian and a mass.

    The quadratic form whose minimizers are k-harmonic functions: ``k == 1`` gives the Dirichlet
    energy ``-L`` (positive semi-definite for a [`cotmatrix`][triwarp.laplacian.cotmatrix]-sign
    Laplacian), ``k == 2`` the biharmonic operator ``L M^-1 L`` behind
    [`harmonic`][triwarp.parametrization.harmonic]'s smooth interpolation, and so on
    (``igl::harmonic_integrated_from_laplacian_and_mass``). Like igl's, the composition is not
    numerically robust for ``k > 2`` — the entries grow as the k-th power of the inverse mesh
    size — so high powers want a float64 ``laplacian``.

    **Named for the operator, not the map.** This used to be ``laplacian.harmonic_integrated``,
    which put a second unrelated "harmonic" in the package beside
    [`harmonic`][triwarp.parametrization.harmonic] — a *map* into the plane, not an operator. The
    two are related (``harmonic`` minimizes this form with the boundary pinned) but they are not
    interchangeable, and neither docstring named the other.

    Each power is assembled by one triplet pass over matching CSR rows —
    ``(A M^-1 B)_ij = sum_t A_ti M_t^-1 B_tj`` with both operands symmetric — followed by a single
    ``bsr_from_triplets``, so the product is built without ``warp.sparse.bsr_mm``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    laplacian
        Square 1x1-block BSR Laplacian in igl's sign convention (negative diagonal, each row
        summing to zero), e.g. from [`cotmatrix`][triwarp.laplacian.cotmatrix] or

    mass
        Length-``n_vertices`` lumped mass diagonal, e.g. from
        [`mass_matrix_entries`][triwarp.laplacian.mass_matrix_entries]; cast to the Laplacian's
        scalar type if it differs. ``None`` (identity mass) composes plain powers of ``-L``, the
        [`tutte`][triwarp.parametrization.tutte] convention. Zero entries are treated as killed
        degrees of freedom (their rows contribute nothing), matching ``igl::invert_diag``.
    k

    Hessian smoothness energy with natural boundary conditions.

    The mixed-FEM quadratic form ``Q = H^T M^-1 H`` of Stein et al. 2018, *Natural Boundary
    Conditions for Smoothing in Geometry Processing*: ``x' Q x`` integrates the squared Hessian of
    the piecewise-linear field ``x``, so minimizing it smooths **without** the boundary distortion
    the clamped biharmonic operator
    ([`k_harmonic`][triwarp.energies.k_harmonic] at ``k == 2``) produces —
    linear functions are exactly in its null space, boundary or not. ``M`` is the Voronoi lumped
    mass with boundary degrees of freedom killed, per the reference.

    Rather than materializing the sparse ``(9 n_faces, n_vertices)`` stacked Hessian ``H``, the
    product is contracted analytically over its nine component pairs and assembled in one triplet
    pass per vertex: ``Q_ij = sum_k M_k^-1 sum_{f,g ni k} A_f A_g (g_fk . g_gk)(g_fi . g_gj)``
    with ``g_fc`` corner ``c``'s hat-function gradient in face ``f``. The per-vertex triplet count
    is ``9 * valence^2``, so cost is quadratic in valence. A degenerate face contributes nothing
    (igl emits NaN there).

    Parameters

    vertices

        Float64 is the default, unlike the first-order operators in this module, because the
        entries scale as the inverse fourth power of the mesh size and the operator exists to be
        solved against.
    vertex_faces
        Optional precomputed [`vertex_face_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.vertex_face_adjacency] as
        ``(vertex_faces, offsets)``. Depends on the connectivity alone, so one CSR serves every
        incidence walk over the same mesh --
        [`Trimesh.vertex_face_adjacency`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.vertex_face_adjacency] has it cached.

    Returns

    Curved Hessian smoothness energy on the Crouzeix-Raviart discretization.

    ``igl::curved_hessian_energy``, from Stein et al. 2020, *A Smoothness Energy without Boundary
    Distortion for Curved Surfaces*: where [`hessian_energy`][triwarp.energies.hessian_energy]
    treats the surface as locally flat, this one carries the Gaussian curvature into the operator
    through a per-vertex angle-defect correction, so the energy is intrinsic to the curved surface
    rather than to its triangles' planes. Constant functions are exactly in its null space.

    Assembled as ``Q = D^T M^-1 (L + K) M^-1 D`` over edge-based Crouzeix-Raviart vector elements
    — ``D`` the scalar-to-CR-vector gradient, ``M`` the CR vector mass, ``L`` the CR vector
    Laplacian and ``K`` the curvature correction — but contracted per face in one pass: ``L + K``
    couples edges within a face only, so each face emits its own 6x6 block sandwiched between its
    edges' gradient rows (a fixed 144 triplets per face), and no intermediate ``(2 n_edges, ...)``
    matrix or sparse product exists. Requires an edge-manifold mesh, like the igl original (which
    asserts it); a degenerate face contributes nothing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    dtype

        with float64 the default for the same conditioning reason as
