"""
Mesh face-adjacency graph: which faces share an edge, and what each adjacent pair looks like.

[`face_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.face_adjacency] is the table every other function here reads:
one row per edge-adjacent face pair. The rest are per-adjacency-row quantities over that table, all
row-aligned with it, so a caller derives the pairs once and passes them in --
[`require_paired_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.require_paired_adjacency] states the one rule those
keywords carry, and is public because the functions taking the pair span three modules.

- [`face_adjacency_unshared`][triwarp.adjacency.face_adjacency_unshared] gives the two opposite
  corners of each pair, and [`face_adjacency_angles`][triwarp.adjacency.face_adjacency_angles] the
  dihedral between the two faces.
- [`face_adjacency_convex`][triwarp.adjacency.face_adjacency_convex] answers whether a pair is
  *convex* -- each face's third vertex on the inner side of the other's plane -- and
  [`face_adjacency_projections`][triwarp.adjacency.face_adjacency_projections] returns the signed
  distances it thresholds, for callers that want the margin rather than the verdict.

[`face_connected_component_labels`][triwarp.adjacency.face_connected_component_labels] is the one
whole-graph answer: face-level connected components over the same adjacency.

    Face index pairs that share an undirected mesh edge.

    Each output row lists two face indices whose triangles share an edge (vertex
    pair). On a closed manifold mesh every interior edge appears exactly twice in
    the edge list, so only edges with duplicate sorted rows are kept—boundary edges
    that appear once are omitted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` buffer of triangle vertex indices, the
        same flat layout as [`triwarp.triangles`][triwarp.triangles] and
        [`faces_to_edges`][triwarp.edges.faces_to_edges].
    edges_sorted
        Optional precomputed ``(n_faces * 3, 2)`` edge rows with each row sorted
        so the smaller vertex index is first (as from
        [`faces_to_edges`][triwarp.edges.faces_to_edges] with
        ``sorted=True``). When ``None``, edges are built from ``faces`` on
        ``faces.device``.
    return_edges
        If ``True``, also return the shared vertex indices for each adjacency row.
    n_vertices
        Optional vertex count, used as the row-hashing radix. It does not change the answer:
        when ``None`` a fixed radix above every ``int32`` index packs the edges instead, in the
        same order, so no reduction or host readback is needed either way. When given it must be
        greater than every index in ``faces``; see the warning on
        [`hash_indices_rows`][triwarp.grouping.hash_indices_rows].
    edges_paired
        Promise that every undirected edge is shared by exactly two faces -- what
        [`is_edge_manifold`][triwarp.validation.is_edge_manifold] with
        ``allow_boundary_edges=False`` establishes. The adjacency then has exactly
        ``3 * n_faces / 2`` rows and they are consecutive in the sorted edge-key order, so the
        run detection, its scan and the host read of the pair count are skipped. The answer is
        byte-identical to the default path on such a mesh. The promise is **not checked** beyond
        the face count's parity: on a mesh with a boundary or a non-manifold edge the rows are
        still valid face indices but pair faces that need not share an edge.

    Returns
    -------
    twt.Array2dInt32 or tuple of two such arrays
        **adjacency** — shape ``(m, 2)`` on ``faces.device``. Row ``k`` gives face
        indices ``(f0, f1)`` with ``f0 <= f1`` (rows sorted in-place). Faces
        ``faces[3*f0:3*f0+3]`` and ``faces[3*f1:3*f1+3]`` share an edge.

        When ``return_edges`` is ``True``, also returns **adjacency_edges** —
        shape ``(m, 2)`` with the sorted vertex pair for that shared edge (one row
        per adjacency pair, taken from the first matching edge row).

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``faces`` and ``edges_sorted`` are not all on one device.
    ValueError
        If ``edges_paired`` is given for an odd face count, where no pairing exists.

    Notes
    -----
    Duplicate-edge grouping uses
    [`group_int_rows`][triwarp.grouping.group_int_rows] with
    ``length=2``, equivalent to [`trimesh.grouping.group_rows`][] with
    ``require_count=2``. An empty mesh yields shape ``(0, 2)``.

    The contract behind every ``face_adjacency=`` / ``face_adjacency_edges=`` keyword in the

    Vertex on each adjacent face that is not on their shared edge.

    two coincident triangles meet along all three of their edges, so they produce three adjacency

        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` buffer of triangle vertex indices, the

    face_adjacency
        Optional ``(m, 2)`` face index pairs from
        [`face_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.face_adjacency]. When
        ``None``, adjacency and shared edges are derived from ``faces`` directly and neither table
        is materialized.
    face_adjacency_edges
        Optional ``(m, 2)`` sorted shared vertex pairs (as from
        [`face_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.face_adjacency] with ``return_edges=True``).
        Must be supplied
        together with ``face_adjacency`` or omitted with it.
    n_vertices
        Optional vertex count used as the row-hashing radix, forwarded to
        [`face_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.face_adjacency]. Ignored when the adjacency tables are
        supplied. It does not change the answer; see that function's note.

    Returns
    -------
    twt.Array2dInt32
        Shape ``(m, 2)`` on ``faces.device``. Row ``k`` gives vertex indices into
        ``faces`` for the corners not on ``face_adjacency_edges[k]``, or ``-1``
        when degenerate. Rows are in the same order
        [`face_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.face_adjacency] returns for the same ``faces``, so the
