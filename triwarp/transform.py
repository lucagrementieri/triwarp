"""
Affine transforms: build a ``4x4`` matrix, apply it to a buffer, and classify what it preserves.

Three layers, and which one a caller wants depends on what they hold. The **buffer ops**
([`transform_points`][triwarp.transform.transform_points] and its vector / normal / mesh siblings)
take a matrix and an array and support in-place operation through ``out=``. The **builders**
([`translation_matrix`][triwarp.transform.translation_matrix],
[`rotation_matrix`][triwarp.transform.rotation_matrix],
[`scale_matrix`][triwarp.transform.scale_matrix],
[`reflection_matrix`][triwarp.transform.reflection_matrix]) compose the matrix on the host, each
about an optional ``center``. And [`classify_transform`][triwarp.transform.classify_transform]
answers what a matrix *preserves* -- lengths, angles, orientation -- which is what
[`Trimesh.transform`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.transform] reads to decide how much of its cache
survives.

Points, vectors and normals are three different maps and picking the wrong one is a silent error
rather than a loud one:

| quantity | maps by | translation |
|---|---|---|
| position | ``M`` | applied |
| displacement, tangent | linear block of ``M`` | ignored |
| **normal** | **inverse transpose** of the linear block | ignored |

The first two agree on everything but the translation, so a normal pushed through
[`transform_vectors`][triwarp.transform.transform_vectors] is *correct under any isometry* and
tilts off the surface under a shear or a non-uniform scale -- tens of degrees off under an
ordinary axis scale. Only unit scale hides it, which is why the distinction gets its own entry
point.

    What an affine transform preserves, ordered from most structure to least.

    Each member's guarantees *include* every later member's: a `TRANSLATION` is a `RIGID` motion
    whose rotation is the identity, and a `RIGID` motion is a `SIMILARITY` of scale 1. The
    ordering is what makes this useful as a cache key -- see
    [`Trimesh.transform`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.transform].

    Attributes
    ----------
    IDENTITY
        Changes nothing.
    TRANSLATION
        Identity linear block. Preserves lengths, angles, orientation **and every direction**, so
        normals and tangent frames are unchanged rather than merely rotated.
    RIGID
        Orthogonal linear block with positive determinant: a rotation, optionally with a
        translation. Preserves lengths, angles and orientation; rotates directions.
    REFLECTION
        Orthogonal linear block with negative determinant *and unit scale*. Preserves lengths and
        unsigned angles but **reverses orientation**, so face winding must be flipped to keep
        normals outward. A mirroring transform that also scales is `SIMILARITY`, not this.
    SIMILARITY
        Orthogonal up to a single factor: a uniform scale, optionally rotated, mirrored and
        translated. Preserves angles and therefore cotangent weights; scales lengths by
        [`transform_scale`][triwarp.transform.transform_scale] and areas by its square. May or
        may not reverse orientation -- unlike the other members this says nothing about that, so
        read the determinant sign separately.
    AFFINE
        An invertible map that is none of the above -- a non-uniform scale or a shear. Being a
        bijection it still preserves connectivity, incidence and self-intersection; nothing
        metric.
    SINGULAR
        Not an invertible affine map: a rank-deficient linear block, or a bottom row that makes
        the matrix projective rather than affine. Flattens the mesh, so even the predicates a
        bijection would preserve are gone and only connectivity survives.

    Map unit normals through an affine transform by its inverse transpose, and renormalize.

        ``4x4`` transform, scalar or ``(1,)`` device array. A device array costs one host readback.
    rtol
        Relative tolerance on the Gram matrix, defaulting to
        [`ORTHOGONALITY_RTOL`][triwarp.transform.ORTHOGONALITY_RTOL]. A matrix composed from many
        ``float32`` rotations eventually drifts past any fixed tolerance and is classified
        `TransformKind.AFFINE` -- conservative, never wrong, but it costs the caller a cache. Pass
        ``assume=`` to [`Trimesh.transform`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.transform] rather than widening
        this.

    Returns
    -------
    TransformKind
        The strongest class the matrix satisfies.

    Notes
    -----
    Singularity is decided from the linear block's singular values, not from its determinant: a
    block is rank-deficient to within ``rtol`` when its smallest singular value is at most an
    ``rtol`` fraction of its largest -- the reciprocal condition number, which stays correct
    however anisotropic the block is. A determinant-vs-scale test would not: a non-uniform scale
    can have an arbitrarily small determinant relative to its trace while remaining perfectly
    invertible (``diag(1000, 1, 1)`` is `TransformKind.AFFINE`, not singular, despite a determinant
    500x below its isotropic-scale expectation).

    Orientation is **not** part of the answer except at `TransformKind.REFLECTION`, which is the
    unit-scale mirror. A mirroring scale is `TransformKind.SIMILARITY`, so a caller that needs to
    know whether winding flips must read ``det`` of the linear block rather than switching on this
    result.

    Examples
    --------
    ```python
    kind = tw.transform.classify_transform(tw.transform.rotation_matrix((0.0, 0.0, 1.0), 0.5))

    the host regardless of which form it arrives in, and this is the one place it crosses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix
        ``4x4`` transform, scalar or ``(1,)`` device array.

    A device array costs one host readback. Every caller here is making a host branch over a whole
