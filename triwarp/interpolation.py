"""
Move a scalar or vector field between the mesh's elements: faces, vertices and edges.

Averaging is the only honest transfer between element types on a mesh, and the direction determines
what it costs: face-to-vertex
([`average_onto_vertices`][triwarp.interpolation.average_onto_vertices]) and edge-to-vertex
([`average_from_edges_onto_vertices`][triwarp.interpolation.average_from_edges_onto_vertices]) are
gathers over the incident elements, while vertex-to-face
([`average_onto_faces`][triwarp.interpolation.average_onto_faces]) is the mean of exactly three
corners and needs no adjacency at all.

These are unweighted means. For an area- or angle-weighted transfer of *normals* specifically, see
[`triwarp.vertices`][triwarp.vertices]; for a UV-space resampling, see
[`triwarp.texture`][triwarp.texture].

[`transfer_onto_vertices`][triwarp.interpolation.transfer_onto_vertices] moves a field between two
*different* meshes instead of between one mesh's element types, by closest-point projection onto the
source surface — the operation you need after a remesh or a decimation has changed the vertex set
under a field. [`interpolate_from_points`][triwarp.interpolation.interpolate_from_points] drops the
mesh requirement entirely: it interpolates a field known on a scattered *cloud*, which is the only
function here whose source has no connectivity to average over, and so the only one that needs a
kernel width rather than an incidence structure.

    """
    Resample a source mesh's per-vertex field onto another mesh's vertices.

    For each target vertex, the closest point on the *source surface* is found and the source field
    is interpolated there barycentrically. This is the transfer to use when two meshes describe the
    same shape at different resolutions — after a remesh, a decimation or a reconstruction — and a
    field computed on one of them has to follow. It is MeshLab's ``transfer_attributes_per_vertex``
    with ``vertexsampling=False``.

    Because the closest point is taken on the surface rather than at the nearest *vertex*, the
    result is continuous in the target positions and exact for a field that is already linear on the
    source triangles — which is what makes it safe to chain (a transfer onto a refinement of the
    same mesh reproduces the field, not a blur of it).

    Parameters
    ----------
    source_vertices
        ``(n_source,)`` source mesh vertex positions.
    source_faces
        Length-``3 * n_source_faces`` ``wp.int32`` source triangle index buffer.
    source_values
        Length-``n_source`` field on the source vertices. Any Warp dtype closed under scaling and
        addition works: ``wp.float32`` for a scalar, ``wp.vec3`` for a normal or a colour.
    target_vertices
        ``(n_target,)`` positions to sample at — usually another mesh's vertices, but any point set
        will do.
    max_dist
        Maximum search radius per target vertex. Targets with no source face within it keep the
        zero-filled output and report ``inf`` in the returned distance, which is how a caller
        detects them. When ``None``, derived from the box enclosing both meshes, so every target
        hits.

    Returns
    -------
    values : wp.array[DType]
        Length-``n_target`` transferred field on ``target_vertices.device``. Zero-filled wherever
        the closest-point query missed.
    distance : wp.array[wp.float32]
        Length-``n_target`` distance from each target vertex to the source surface — the transfer's
        own confidence measure, and ``inf`` for a miss.

    """
    Carry a per-vertex field through a topology edit, using the edit's own interpolation operator.

    The companion of [`triwarp.remesh.subdivide_loop`][triwarp.remesh.subdivide_loop]'s
    ``return_operator``: that pass moves *and* creates vertices, so an output vertex is an affine
    combination of several input ones and no index map can express the correspondence. The operator
    can, and applying it to a field is the same product that produced the new positions:
    ``transfer_through_operator(vertices, P)`` reproduces the subdivided vertex buffer, which is
    what makes this exact rather than a resampling.

    Prefer this over
    [`transfer_onto_vertices`][triwarp.interpolation.transfer_onto_vertices] whenever the operator
    is available: that one projects onto the source surface and is therefore lossy by construction,
    where this one applies the very weights the edit used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values
        Length-``n_source`` field on the input vertices. Any **float32-based** Warp dtype closed
        under scaling and addition: ``wp.float32`` for a scalar, ``wp.vec2`` for a UV, ``wp.vec3``
        for a normal or a colour. Not ``wp.float64`` -- see Notes.
    operator
        ``(n_out, n_source)`` ``float32`` interpolation matrix, as returned by
        ``subdivide_loop(..., return_operator=True)``.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[DType]
        Length-``n_out`` transferred field on ``values.device``, of the same dtype as ``values``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the operator's column count does not match ``values``.

    Examples
    --------
    ```python
    field = tw.vertices.vertex_normals(v, f)  # per-vertex field
    fine_v, fine_f, prolongation = tw.remesh.subdivide_loop(v, f, return_operator=True)
    fine_field = tw.interpolation.transfer_through_operator(field, prolongation)
    ```

    Notes
    -----
    An output row the operator leaves empty gets the dtype's zero rather than uninitialized memory,
    so a partial operator is safe to apply.

    ``warp.sparse.bsr_mv`` would serve for a ``float32`` field and nothing else -- its vector dtype
    has to match the matrix's 1x1 block -- so this goes through a small CSR kernel instead, which is
    what makes the ``wp.vec2`` and ``wp.vec3`` cases (a UV, a colour) reachable at all.

    The field's scalar must be ``float32`` because the operator's weights are: Warp requires both
    operands of a product to share a scalar type, so a ``wp.float64`` field does not compile against
    a float32 operator. Cast it with ``wp.utils.array_cast`` if that is what you hold. The
    restriction is honest rather than incidental -- these operators are assembled from float32
    vertex data, so carrying a float64 field through one would advertise precision the weights do
    not have.

    --------
    [`triwarp.remesh.subdivide_loop`][triwarp.remesh.subdivide_loop]
        The one edit in this package that publishes such an operator.
    [`transfer_onto_vertices`][triwarp.interpolation.transfer_onto_vertices]

    [`triwarp.array.gather`][triwarp.array.gather]
        What to use instead where the edit *can* report an index map -- ``split_edges`` and
        ``subdivide_to_size`` both do, and a gather through their ``index`` is the whole transfer.

    Interpolate a field known on a scattered point cloud at arbitrary query points.

    A Gaussian-weighted mean of each query's neighbours, weight
    ``exp(-(sharpness * d / radius) ** 2)`` — the one transfer in this module that needs no mesh on
    either side, since the source is a bare cloud. Use it to bring a measured or simulated field

    [`transfer_onto_vertices`][triwarp.interpolation.transfer_onto_vertices] instead when the source

    is a smoothing, and
    [`sample_grid_trilinear`][triwarp.voxels.sample_grid_trilinear] when the source is a dense
    lattice, where trilinear weights are exact rather than a kernel estimate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source_points
        ``(n_source,)`` positions the field is known at.
    source_values
        Length-``n_source`` field on those points. Any Warp dtype closed under scaling and addition
        works: ``wp.float32`` for a scalar, ``wp.vec3`` for a vector.
    query_points
        ``(n_query,)`` positions to interpolate at.
    radius
        Length scale of the kernel, and — unless ``k`` is given — the footprint: only sources within
        it contribute. **Required**, and absolute: it is in the coordinates' own units, so a cloud
        rescaled by 100 needs a radius rescaled by 100. Derive it from the data rather than guessing
        (e.g. [`mean_edge_length`][triwarp.edges.mean_edge_length] or
        [`knn_initial_radius`][triwarp.neighbors.knn_initial_radius]).
    k
        When given, use the ``k`` nearest sources of each query as the footprint instead of every
        source within ``radius``, at any distance. ``radius`` still sets the kernel's length scale.
    sharpness
        Falloff: a larger value reduces the influence of distant sources. At ``sharpness``,
        a source at ``radius`` weighs ``exp(-sharpness ** 2)``.
    null_value
        Value written where a query has no neighbour at all (or where every weight underflowed to
        zero). For a ``wp.vec3`` field it fills every component.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[DType]
        Length-``n_query`` interpolated field on ``query_points.device``, with ``source_values``'
        dtype.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``source_values`` does not have one entry per source point, if ``radius`` is not
        positive, or if ``k`` is given and is not positive.

    Notes
    -----
    A query that coincides with a source takes that source's value exactly rather than blending its
    neighbours, so the interpolant reproduces the data at the data. VTK's kernels do the same.

    This is ``vtkPointInterpolator`` with a ``vtkGaussianKernel``, which pyvista exposes as
    ``DataSet.interpolate``. Two conventions of the reference are deliberately not copied: it
    clamps ``sharpness`` up to ``1.0`` (so its own ``0.5`` behaves as ``1.0``), and it offers
    ``mask_points`` / ``closest_point`` fallbacks for a query with no neighbour. The mask is
    ``counts == 0`` from [`query_ball_count`][triwarp.neighbors.query_ball_count] and the
    closest-point fallback is this function at ``k=1``, so neither needs a mode of its own.
