"""
What the whole mesh adds up to: the volume it encloses, its moments and its Euler characteristic.

Every function here reduces the entire surface to a single host-side number (or a small tuple of
them), which is why they are gathered rather than left beside the per-element fields they sum over.
Each therefore costs at least one host readback and forces a device synchronisation -- call them
once and keep the answer, and reach for [`triwarp.reduce`][triwarp.reduce] when a reduction should
stay on the device.

Three of the four are **mass properties of the enclosed solid**, and all three are only meaningful
on a closed, consistently wound surface -- [`is_volume`][triwarp.validation.is_volume] is the check
for that, and [`make_volume`][triwarp.repair.make_volume] the repair.
[`volume`][triwarp.measures.volume] is the signed volume,
[`moments`][triwarp.measures.moments] adds the centre of mass and the inertia tensor, and
[`surface_centroid`][triwarp.measures.surface_centroid] is the one member that is a *normalized*
total rather than a sum: the area-weighted mean of the per-face centroids. It is a property of the
**shell**, so it differs from ``moments``' centre of mass on any solid whose mass is not distributed
like its surface -- and it needs no watertightness, since a surface has a centroid whether or not it
bounds anything.

[`euler_characteristic`][triwarp.measures.euler_characteristic] is the odd one out: a topological
invariant rather than a measurement, counted off the index buffer with no geometry involved. It sits
here because it is a whole-mesh integer, and it is what
[`homology_generators`][triwarp.homology.homology_generators] derives the genus from.

    """
    Signed volume enclosed by the mesh.

    Sum of per-face signed tetrahedron volumes measured from the origin
    (``dot(v0, cross(v1, v2)) / 6``); for a closed, consistently wound surface this is
    independent of the reference point, and its sign follows the orientation of the face
    normals (positive for outward-facing normals). For an open or inconsistently wound mesh
    the result is not a meaningful volume.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions, ``wp.vec3`` or ``wp.vec3d``. The accumulation
        follows: pass ``vec3d`` where the sum's low digits matter, as
        [`filter_laplacian`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_laplacian]'s volume constraint does.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Signed volume, accumulated in ``vertices``' scalar type. ``0.0`` for an empty mesh.

    A *normalized* total rather than a sum, and a property of the shell alone -- unlike
    [`moments`][triwarp.measures.moments]' centre of mass it needs no watertightness and no
    consistent winding, because a surface has a centroid whether or not it bounds a solid. The two

    vertices

    """
    Mass properties of the solid bounded by the mesh: volume, centre of mass and inertia tensor.

    Integrates over the enclosed solid at unit density by summing the contribution of every
    (origin, face) tetrahedron, so the result is only meaningful for a **closed, consistently
    wound** surface -- the same precondition [`volume`][triwarp.measures.volume] carries, and
    [`is_volume`][triwarp.validation.is_volume] is the check for it.

    The integrals accumulate in ``float64`` even though the positions are ``float32``: the second
    moments scale as ``length ** 5``, so a ``float32`` sum loses their low digits on any sizeable
    mesh.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.

    Returns
    -------
    volume : float
        Signed volume, identical to [`volume`][triwarp.measures.volume] up to its ``float32``
        accumulation.
    center_of_mass : wp.vec3
        Volume centroid, i.e. the first moment divided by the volume. This is **not**
        [`surface_centroid`][triwarp.measures.surface_centroid], the area-weighted centre of the
        *surface*; the two differ on any solid whose mass is not distributed like its shell.
    inertia : wp.mat33d
        ``(3, 3)`` inertia tensor about the centre of mass, at unit density. ``float64``, like the
        integrals it is assembled from -- a ``wp.mat33`` would discard exactly the low digits this
        function accumulates in double precision to keep.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices`` and ``faces`` are not all on one device.

    Notes
    -----
    ``igl.moments`` returns ``(m0, m1, m2)`` where ``m1`` is the first moment -- the centre of mass
    times the mass -- rather than the centre of mass itself, and ``m2`` is already referred to the
    centre of mass (verified against a translated mesh, not assumed). This function returns the
    decoded forms, so the transform between the two is ``m1 / m0``.

    Three host readbacks are unavoidable here: all three returns are host-side values, so the ten
    accumulated sums have to cross the device boundary to be combined.
