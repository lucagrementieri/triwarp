"""
Laplacian smoothing filters, for vertex positions and for per-vertex scalar fields.

Most of the module moves *geometry*: [`filter_laplacian`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_laplacian],
[`filter_taubin`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_taubin],
[`filter_humphrey`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_humphrey],
[`filter_neighborhood_average`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_neighborhood_average],
[`filter_mut_dif_laplacian`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_mut_dif_laplacian] and
[`filter_implicit_fairing`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_implicit_fairing] all diffuse vertex positions
through the same row-stochastic 1-ring operator, differing in the time integration and in what they
do to counteract shrinkage. [`smooth_region`][triwarp.smoothing.smooth_region] and its
sharp-boundary variant instead solve a Dirichlet problem over a *region*, holding the rest of the
mesh fixed.

Three functions work on the *normal* field instead of positions, which is what lets them keep a
crease sharp: [`filter_normals`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_normals] diffuses face normals with a
crease gate, [`filter_two_step`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_two_step] then refits the vertices to
them, and [`filter_sharpen`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_sharpen] runs the whole idea backwards to
*sharpen*.

A second group relaxes toward something *other* than a Laplacian residual, which is what lets each
member fix a failure the filters above cannot see:
[`equalize_triangle_areas`][triwarp.smoothing.equalize_triangle_areas] evens out triangle areas,
[`relax_keep_volume`][triwarp.smoothing.relax_keep_volume] removes the shrinkage locally instead of
rescaling it away at the end, [`relax_approx`][triwarp.smoothing.relax_approx] fits a plane or a
quadric to a whole geodesic neighbourhood rather than averaging a 1-ring, and
[`filter_spikes`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_spikes] moves only the vertices that fail an angle test.
The first three take a vertex ``region`` and a ``max_displacement`` bound, so a relaxation can be
confined to where it is wanted and kept within a tolerance of the surface it started from;
``filter_spikes`` needs neither, because the set it touches is the answer to its own test.
[`smooth_region_boundary`][triwarp.smoothing.smooth_region_boundary] completes the region trio by
smoothing the region's *rim curve*, where the two above it smooth across the rim or inside it.

**The verb tracks the mechanism, not the group.** ``filter_*`` runs a fixed operator to a schedule
-- an assembled Laplacian, a normal-field pass, a windowed Taubin pair -- so the answer is a
function of the operator and the iteration count. ``relax_*`` iterates against a *geometric*
objective and re-derives its target every pass, which is why those take a ``max_displacement``
bound: nothing in the mechanism keeps the result near the input. ``equalize_triangle_areas`` and
``smooth_region*`` name their objective outright because there is only one of each. By that axis
[`filter_spikes`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_spikes] is correctly a ``filter_*``: it runs the same
fixed 1-ring operator, and only its *selection* is geometric.

[`filter_scalar_laplacian`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_scalar_laplacian] runs the same operator over a
per-vertex **scalar** field rather than positions. Capping how fast such a field may vary along an
edge -- the other half of turning a raw scalar into a usable sizing field -- is not a smoothing
filter at all but a one-sided Lipschitz projection, and lives in
[`shortest_path_envelope`][triwarp.graph.shortest_path_envelope].

    Laplacian mesh smoothing (Vollmer et al.; Desbrun et al. implicit fairing).

    Diffuses each vertex toward the mean of its 1-ring neighbors. With ``implicit_time_integration``
    the diffusion is solved implicitly (backward Euler, unconditionally stable); otherwise an
    explicit forward-Euler step is used (stable for ``lamb <= 1``). Mirrors
    [`trimesh.smoothing.filter_laplacian`][] but returns a new vertex array instead of mutating
    the mesh in place.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    lamb
        Diffusion speed. ``0`` leaves the mesh unchanged; larger values smooth faster.
    iterations
        Number of smoothing passes.
    implicit_time_integration
        If ``True`` solve ``((1 + lamb) I - lamb L) V' = V`` each pass. The system is strictly
        diagonally dominant for a row-stochastic ``L``, so it is solved by a fixed-point iteration
        whose step count follows from ``lamb`` and ``L``'s row sums -- ``L`` is not symmetric on a
        mesh with a boundary, so a symmetric Krylov method does not apply -- falling back to
        BiCGSTAB when that count is large or ``L`` is not a contraction. If ``False`` apply the
        explicit step ``V' = V + lamb (L V - V)``. An unreferenced vertex, whose row of ``L`` is
        empty, stays where it is on both paths.
    volume_constraint
        If ``True`` rescale the mesh after each pass to preserve its initial volume, counteracting
        Laplacian shrinkage.
    laplacian_operator
        Optional precomputed row-stochastic operator (see
        [`laplacian`][triwarp.laplacian.laplacian]). Autogenerated (uniform weights) when ``None``.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.vec3]

    Raises
    ------

    Inflate a surface under uniform pressure: normal displacement alternating with smoothing.

    The "balloon" flow. Each pass moves every vertex along its own
    [`vertex_normals`][triwarp.vertices.vertex_normals] at ``weighting="area"`` and then relaxes
    with one Laplacian pass, which is what keeps the triangles from shearing as the surface grows.
    Uses of it: puffing a thin shell out to a printable thickness, opening a collapsed scan, and
    supplying a starting surface a fitting loop can shrink back onto data.

    ``pressure`` is an absolute distance per pass, in the mesh's own units, so scale it off
    something intrinsic -- a fraction of the mean edge length is the usual choice. With ``gradual``
    pass ``k`` of ``n`` uses ``pressure * (k + 1) / n`` rather than the full amount, which is
    gentler on a mesh with fine triangles: the early passes let the relaxation redistribute
    before the later ones push hard.

    !!! note "Not the implicit formulation"
        The reference inflations displace and then solve an *implicit* Laplacian system, where
        this runs one explicit pass -- so the two produce different surfaces from the same
        ``pressure``, and the tests compare the properties an inflation must have (volume grows,
        the displacement is normal-aligned) rather than positions. Pass the result through
        [`filter_implicit_fairing`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_implicit_fairing] if you want that
        formulation; it costs a conjugate-gradient solve per pass, which is why it is not the

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    pressure
        Distance to move along the normal per pass. Negative deflates.
    iterations
        Number of displace-and-relax passes.
    pre_smooth
        Run one relaxation pass *before* the first displacement. Worth it on a noisy input, where
        the normals are what the noise corrupts and displacing along them amplifies it.
    gradual
        Ramp the pressure linearly across the passes instead of applying it in full each time.
    lamb
        Relaxation strength of each Laplacian pass, as

        Shrinkage control in ``[0, 1]``: ``0`` ignores the original positions, ``1`` disables
        smoothing.
    beta
        Correction aggressiveness in ``[0, 1]``: ``0`` disables smoothing, ``1`` is most aggressive.
    iterations
        Number of smoothing passes.
    laplacian_operator

    """
    Pull needle-like vertices back onto the surface, leaving every other vertex untouched.

    A *spike* is a vertex whose incident corner angles sum to less than ``min_angle_sum``. On a
    flat surface that sum is ``2 * pi``; the sharper the cone, the smaller it gets, and a vertex on
    a thin needle -- the classic scan and reconstruction artifact -- has a sum near zero. So the
    threshold is read in radians against a full turn, and a value like ``0.5 * pi`` selects
    genuinely degenerate cones while leaving ordinary sharp features alone.

    Each pass replaces the flagged vertices by the average of their closed 1-rings and **nothing
    else moves**: this is not a smoothing filter restricted to a region, it is a repair that touches
    only the vertices that fail the test. Flattening a spike changes its neighbours' angle sums, so
    the pass repeats -- a needle whose base is itself spiky needs more than one -- and stops as soon
    as a pass finds none.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    min_angle_sum
        Angle-sum threshold in radians. A vertex is a spike when its incident angles sum below it.
        Compare against ``2 * pi``, the flat value.
    max_iter
        Cap on the number of passes.
    return_count
        If ``True``, also return ``flattened``.

    Returns
    -------
    vertices : wp.array[wp.vec3]
        Repaired positions on ``vertices.device``. Connectivity is untouched, so ``faces`` stays
        valid.
    flattened : int, optional
        Present when ``return_count=True``. How many vertex moves were made, summed over the passes
        -- so a vertex fixed twice counts twice, which makes it a report rather than a count of
        anything in the output. Zero means nothing was flagged and the buffer is the input's. The
        pass loop stops itself as soon as a pass finds no spike, so the default return is a bare
        position buffer that drops into a filter chain like every other function here.

    Even out triangle *areas* by moving vertices, without touching the connectivity.

    Every other filter in this module drives the surface toward a Laplacian residual of zero, which
    equalizes *edge* directions and says nothing about area: a patch of long thin triangles beside a
    patch of fat ones is already Laplacian-smooth. This one minimizes the summed squared areas of
    each vertex's incident triangles instead, which is the objective that actually redistributes
    them -- a vertex sitting close to one of its opposite edges is pushed away from it.

    Twice a triangle's area is ``|(x - p) x (q - p)|`` for the free vertex ``x`` over its opposite
    edge ``(p, q)``, so the per-vertex objective is a sum of quadratic forms and its minimum is one
    3x3 solve, taken in ``float64``. Each pass steps a fraction ``force`` of the way there, from the
    *previous* pass's positions, so the whole mesh moves at once and the result does not depend on
    a vertex ordering.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    iterations
        Number of passes. ``0`` returns a copy.
    force
        Fraction of the way to the per-vertex minimum each pass moves. ``1.0`` jumps straight there
        and oscillates on an irregular mesh; the default is the usual under-relaxation.
    no_shrinkage
        Constrain each vertex to the tangent plane through its current position, so it slides
        across the surface instead of sinking into it. The unconstrained minimum of *squared* area
        pulls the whole 1-ring inward, so leave this on when the shape matters and off when only
        the triangle quality does.
    region
        ``(n_vertices,)`` boolean mask of the vertices allowed to move. ``None`` moves every one.
        Vertices outside it stay exactly where they are, and are still read as neighbours.
    max_displacement
        Clamp every vertex into a ball of this radius around its **input** position, applied after
        each pass. ``None`` leaves the relaxation unbounded. Use it when the surface has to stay
        within a tolerance of the scan it came from.
    vertex_faces
        Optional precomputed [`vertex_face_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.vertex_face_adjacency] as
        ``(vertex_faces, offsets)``. Depends on the connectivity alone -- which this filter never
        changes -- so one CSR serves every call over the same mesh, and
        [`Trimesh.vertex_face_adjacency`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.vertex_face_adjacency] has it cached.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.vec3]
        Relaxed ``(n_vertices,)`` positions on ``vertices.device``. Connectivity is untouched, so
        ``faces`` stays valid.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``iterations`` is negative, if ``max_displacement`` is negative, or if ``region`` is not
        a length-``n_vertices`` ``wp.bool`` array.
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices``, ``faces``, ``region`` and ``vertex_faces`` are not all on one device.

    Notes
    -----
    !!! note "It equalizes areas, not shapes"
        Nothing here bounds a triangle's aspect ratio, and a long thin triangle can have exactly the
        right area. For shape, flip the triangulation
        ([`flip_by_objective`][triwarp.remesh.flip_by_objective]) or remesh
        ([`isotropic_remesh`][triwarp.remesh.isotropic_remesh]); this moves vertices only.

    Uniform relaxation with the shrinkage taken out **locally**, rather than rescaled away.

    A plain 1-ring average moves every vertex toward the inside of the surface it curves around,
    so a closed shape loses volume with every pass.
    [`filter_laplacian`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_laplacian]'s ``volume_constraint`` answers that
    by rescaling the whole mesh at the end, which restores the total and is wrong everywhere the
    shrinkage was not uniform. This answers it per vertex instead: the relax displacement is
    computed as a *field*, and each vertex then has its own neighbourhood's **average
    displacement** subtracted from its own.

    That difference is the whole method. A translation shared by a neighbourhood -- which is what
    shrinkage locally is -- cancels exactly, while the high-frequency part of the displacement,
    which is the noise the relax was for, survives untouched. No global rescale, and a mesh with a
    flat region and a curved one is treated correctly in both.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices

    Move each vertex onto a surface fitted to its **neighbourhood**, rather than toward its 1-ring.

    Every diffusion filter here is a 1-ring operator, so the largest feature it can see is one edge
    across and its idea of "where the surface is" is the average of six neighbours. This fits a
    local surface -- a least-squares plane, or a quadric graph over that plane -- to every vertex
    inside a geodesic ball of ``dilate_radius`` and moves the vertex onto it. The ball is what makes
    it different in kind: noise smaller than the radius is averaged out in one pass instead of being
    diffused away over many, and the fitted surface is not pulled off the shape by the vertex being
    fitted.

    ``fit="planar"`` flattens: it is the strongest of the two and will take the curvature out of a
    genuinely curved surface if the radius is large. ``fit="quadric"`` keeps curvature, because a
    curved surface *is* in its model space, and is the one to use on anything but a plate.

    The neighbourhood is a **geodesic** ball ([`geodesic_ball`][triwarp.neighbors.geodesic_ball]),
    not a Euclidean one, so the opposite wall of a thin tube is excluded even when it is close --
    which is exactly the case that corrupts a fit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    dilate_radius
        Radius of the neighbourhood ball, in world units. It has no scale-free default: below one
        edge length the ball is the vertex alone and the call is a no-op, and the useful range
        starts at a small multiple of the mean edge length
        ([`edges_unique_length`][triwarp.edges.edges_unique_length]).
    iterations
        Number of passes. ``0`` returns a copy. The neighbourhoods are built **once**, from the
        input positions, and reused -- the ball's membership is a topological choice and rebuilding
        it per pass would cost more than the fit.
    force
        Fraction of the way to the fitted surface each pass moves.
    fit
        ``"planar"`` for a least-squares plane, ``"quadric"`` for a 6-coefficient quadric graph over
        it.
    region
        ``(n_vertices,)`` boolean mask of the vertices allowed to move. ``None`` moves every one.
        Vertices outside it still populate their neighbours' balls.
    max_displacement
        Clamp every vertex into a ball of this radius around its **input** position, applied after
        each pass. ``None`` leaves the relaxation unbounded.

    Returns

    nu
        Inflating step size in ``[0, 1]``; typically chosen so ``0 < 1/lamb - 1/nu < 0.1``.

    Raises

        The operator this applies, and the ``equal_weight`` switch ``recompute`` pins to ``False``.

    Notes
    -----
    ``recompute`` is a different filter, not a tuning of this one:
    ``pytorch3d.ops.taubin_smoothing`` rebuilds its inverse-distance operator from the current
    geometry before each half-pass, and matching that convention is what makes ``recompute=True``
    agree with it, where the fixed operator does not. The default is unchanged and stays the fixed
    operator, which is trimesh's filter and this group's oracle.

    It is pinned to the **inverse-distance** weighting rather than taking a weighting of its own,
    and that is not a simplification: the uniform operator is ``1 / degree`` off the diagonal, a
    function of the connectivity alone, which a position filter never changes -- so recomputing it
    would rebuild the identical matrix every pass and cost without doing anything. Only the
    geometry-dependent branch has anything to recompute.

    ``recompute`` reassembles a sparse operator every pass instead of once, which is markedly more
    expensive; the connectivity never changes, though, so ``laplacian``'s ``edges`` keyword lets
    every pass share one ``edges_unique`` call rather than re-deriving it each time.

    Laplacian smoothing with a mutable diffusion coefficient (Barroqueiro et al.).

    Each pass runs a Laplacian diffusion step whose speed is adapted **per vertex**: the
    coefficient ``lamber`` is scaled by how much of the vertex's Laplacian residual lies along
    its normal, so flat regions diffuse quickly while feature regions diffuse slowly. When
    ``volume_constraint`` is set, the mesh is inflated along its vertex normals (rather than
    isotropically rescaled) to counteract shrinkage. Mirrors
    [`trimesh.smoothing.filter_mut_dif_laplacian`][] but returns a new vertex array instead of
    mutating the mesh in place.

    Following the reference, the vertex normals (and the finite-difference step ``eps``) are
    computed once from the input mesh and held constant across all passes.

    volume_constraint
        If ``True`` inflate the mesh along its vertex normals after each pass to preserve its

    Implicit fairing with the cotangent Laplace-Beltrami operator (Desbrun et al.).

    Solves the backward-Euler diffusion ``(M - lamb L) V' = M V`` each pass, where ``L`` is the
    cotangent stiffness matrix ([`cotmatrix`][triwarp.laplacian.cotmatrix]) and ``M`` the
    barycentric lumped mass matrix ([`mass_matrix`][triwarp.laplacian.mass_matrix]), both recomputed
    from the current geometry. This is the most accurate of the smoothing filters (curvature flow;
    libigl tutorial 205). The solve uses ``float64`` throughout.

    On a mesh with an open boundary the flow needs a boundary condition, which is what
    ``pin_boundary`` supplies: without one the unconstrained boundary is pulled inward, collapsing
    the triangles there, and since the system is solved by conjugate gradient (the only Warp solver
    available) further passes diverge rather than degrade gracefully. Pinning turns the pass into a
    Dirichlet problem over the interior, which is the formulation Desbrun et al. give for a surface
    with boundary and is well posed for any number of passes.

    A closed mesh has no boundary, so ``pin_boundary`` costs nothing and changes nothing there --
    the solve is over every vertex either way, and curvature flow on a closed surface still shrinks
    it (a sphere contracts toward a point, which is the method working, not failing).

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    lamb
        Diffusion time step. Larger values smooth faster; the implicit solve is unconditionally
        stable.
    iterations
        Number of smoothing passes.
    pin_boundary
        Hold boundary vertices at their input positions and solve only for the interior. A no-op on
        a closed mesh. Set ``False`` for the unconstrained flow, which is free to shrink the
        boundary — expect [`solve_spd`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd] to warn once it stops converging.

    Returns

    n_vertices_before
        Vertex count before the patch was appended. Everything at or above this index is a patch
        vertex, which is how the smooth step finds the vertices it may move.
    patch_face_mask
        ``(n_faces,)`` flag marking the patch faces to refine and smooth.
    max_edge
        Target edge length for ``refine="max_edge"``. Ignored under ``"density"``.
    max_edge_splits
        Soft cap on the number of edge splits during subdivision. Ignored under ``"density"``.
    max_angle_change_after_flip
        Dihedral-angle-change gate for the Delaunay flip pass, in radians.
    smooth_curvature
        When ``True``, smooth the new patch vertices after subdivision. When ``False`` the function
        returns straight after refining.
    smooth_boundary
        When ``True``, let the patch rim move as well as its interior.
    natural_smooth
        When ``True``, additionally grow a collar around the patch and smooth it so the patch blends
        into the surrounding surface.
    edge_weights
        Laplacian edge weights for the smooth solve: ``"cotan"`` or ``"unit"``.
    refine
        Subdivision criterion, as above.

    vertices : wp.array[wp.vec3]

    [`smooth_region_fixed_rim`][triwarp.smoothing.smooth_region_fixed_rim] holds the rim still while
    smoothing inside it; both leave the rim's own path through the mesh exactly where the face
    selection put it. That path is usually ragged -- a selection by angle, by height or by a paint
    stroke follows triangle edges and zigzags -- and this is what makes it a smooth curve, without
    moving the surface off itself in any visible way.

    The rim is smoothed as a **level set** rather than as a polyline. A field is pinned to ``-1`` on
    the region's vertices and ``+1`` outside, its harmonic interpolation is solved over the band of
    vertices that touch both sides, and each of those vertices is moved onto the zero level set of
    the result. Harmonic interpolation is smooth, so its zero set is a smooth curve; the vertices
    slide along the surface to sit on it. Repeating recomputes the field from the moved positions,
    and the move is damped so the sequence settles rather than oscillates.

        ``(n_faces,)`` boolean mask selecting the region whose rim is smoothed. The rim is derived
        from it; only vertices that touch both a selected and an unselected face may move.
    iterations
        Number of solve-and-project passes. ``0`` returns a copy.
    vertex_faces
        Optional precomputed [`vertex_face_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.vertex_face_adjacency] as
        ``(vertex_faces, offsets)``. Depends on the connectivity alone -- which this filter never
        changes -- so one CSR serves every call over the same mesh, and
        [`Trimesh.vertex_face_adjacency`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.vertex_face_adjacency] has it cached.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.vec3]
        Positions on ``vertices.device`` with the rim band slid along the surface. Connectivity and
        the face mask are untouched, so ``region`` stays valid against the result.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``iterations`` is negative, or if ``region`` is not a length-``n_faces`` ``wp.bool``
        array.
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices``, ``faces``, ``region`` and ``vertex_faces`` are not all on one device.

    See Also
    --------
    [`smooth_region`][triwarp.smoothing.smooth_region]
        Smooths the surface across the rim, leaving the rim's path alone.
    [`smooth_region_fixed_rim`][triwarp.smoothing.smooth_region_fixed_rim]
        Smooths inside the rim, holding it fixed.
    [`region_boundary_edges`][triwarp.selection.region_boundary_edges]
        The rim as an edge list, which is what this leaves in a better place.

    Notes
    -----
    !!! note "It slides vertices; it does not re-cut the rim"
        The rim can only become as smooth as the *existing* triangulation lets it: a vertex slides
        to the level set but the rim still passes through the same vertices, so a curve that wants
        to cross a triangle diagonally cannot. Retriangulating the band first
        ([`flip_by_objective`][triwarp.remesh.flip_by_objective], or
        [`split_faces_along_field`][triwarp.intersection.split_faces_along_field] to cut along the
        level set outright) is the way to get past that, and is deliberately not folded in here --
        it changes the face buffer, which this promises not to.

    Diffuse a per-vertex scalar field through the 1-ring averaging operator.

    The scalar counterpart of [`filter_laplacian`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_laplacian], running the
    identical explicit step ``q' = q + lamb (L q - q)`` on a field rather than on positions. Reach
    for it whenever a computed per-vertex quantity is noisier than the thing it will drive —
    curvature before it selects features, a heat or occlusion field before it becomes a weight, a
    per-vertex sizing function before it drives remeshing.

    On a **closed** mesh, ``lamb=1.0, iterations=1`` is exactly MeshLab's
    ``apply_scalar_smoothing_per_vertex``: one unweighted 1-ring average with the vertex's own value
    excluded. The defaults instead match the rest of this module (a partial step, repeated), which
    is the gentler behaviour a caller usually wants.

    !!! note "It differs from MeshLab on a boundary"
        VCG's ``VertexQualityLaplacian`` smooths a boundary vertex along the **boundary curve
        only** — it averages just that vertex's two boundary neighbours and ignores the rest of its
        ring, so the boundary values evolve as an independent 1D field. That is a different
        operator, not this one with other constants, and it is why the pymeshlab oracle in
        ``tests/test_smoothing.py`` runs on closed fixtures. Here a boundary vertex averages its
        whole ring like any other; to hold the boundary fixed instead, restore its values after the
        call.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values
        Length-``n_vertices`` ``wp.float32`` field to smooth. Not modified.
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions — needed only to build the operator, and ignored
        when ``laplacian_operator`` is supplied.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    lamb
        Step size. ``0`` leaves the field unchanged, ``1`` replaces each value by its 1-ring
        average outright. Values above ``1`` overshoot and are unstable.
    iterations
        Number of passes. ``0`` returns a copy of the input.
    laplacian_operator
        Optional precomputed row-stochastic operator (see
        [`laplacian`][triwarp.laplacian.laplacian]). Pass it to hoist the build out of a loop, or
        to smooth with inverse-edge-length weights instead.

        When ``None`` it is built as ``laplacian(vertices, faces, symmetric=True)`` — the
        **symmetric** 1-ring, unlike [`filter_laplacian`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_laplacian],
        which defaults to trimesh's directed ``mesh.edges`` adjacency. The two agree on a closed
        mesh and differ on a boundary vertex, where the directed adjacency is missing some of its
        neighbours; for a scalar field the symmetric ring is both the defensible choice and the one
        MeshLab makes.

    Smooth the *face normals* without moving a vertex, preserving creases.

    Each pass replaces a face's normal with the area-weighted average of its own and those of its
    edge-neighbours **whose normal is within ``threshold`` of it**. That gate is what makes this
    feature-preserving rather than isotropic: across a crease the two normals disagree by more than
    the threshold and never average, so a sharp edge survives any number of passes while noise on a
    flat region diffuses away in a few. MeshLab's ``apply_normal_smoothing_per_face``.

    The result is a normal field that is no longer the geometric normal of any triangle — it is the
    *target* for [`filter_two_step`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_two_step]'s second half, and useful on
    its own for shading.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions. Not modified.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    iterations
        Number of diffusion passes over the normal field. MeshLab's ``stepnormalnum``, whose default
        of ``20`` is this one.
    threshold
        Angle in **degrees** beyond which two neighbouring faces refuse to average. ``0`` averages
        nothing and ``180`` averages everything (isotropic). MeshLab's ``normalthr``, default
        ``60``. Must be in ``[0, 180]``.
    face_adjacency
        Optional ``(m, 2)`` adjacency from
        [`face_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.face_adjacency]; recomputed when ``None``. Pass it to
        hoist the build out of a loop — the topology never changes here, so it is safe to reuse.
    face_normals
        Optional length-``n_faces`` unit face normals and matching areas from
        [`face_normals_and_areas`][triwarp.triangles.face_normals_and_areas]; recomputed together
        when either is ``None``. [`Trimesh.face_normals`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.face_normals] and

    Feature-preserving smoothing: filter the face normals, then fit the vertices to them.

    The one filter in this module that does **not** blur a crease. Every other scheme here diffuses
    positions directly, which cannot distinguish noise from a sharp edge — both are high-frequency.
    Two-step smoothing (Ohtake et al., and MeshLab's ``apply_coord_two_steps_smoothing``) separates
    the two questions:

    1. **Where should the surface face?** Diffuse the *normal* field with
       [`filter_normals`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_normals], whose threshold refuses to average
       across a crease. Noise is removed; the crease is not.
    2. **Where should the vertices go?** Move each vertex so the planes through its incident faces'
       centroids with those filtered normals agree as well as possible — a gradient step repeated
       ``fit_iterations`` times, with no free step size (the average over incident faces is the
       step).

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions. Not modified.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer. The topology never changes.
    iterations
        Number of outer passes; each one re-derives the normals from the current positions and
        refits. MeshLab's ``stepsmoothnum``, default ``3``.
    threshold
        Crease threshold in **degrees** for the normal filter. See
        [`filter_normals`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_normals]. MeshLab's ``normalthr``, default
        ``60``.
    normal_iterations
        Normal-diffusion passes per outer pass. MeshLab's ``stepnormalnum``, default ``20``.
    fit_iterations
        Vertex-fitting gradient steps per outer pass. MeshLab's ``stepfitnum``, default ``20``.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.vec3]
        Smoothed ``(n_vertices,)`` vertex positions on ``vertices.device``.

    Raises

    ValueError
        If ``threshold`` is outside ``[0, 180]``.

    Notes
    -----
    There is no volume constraint and none is needed: the fitting step moves each vertex *along* the
    filtered normals rather than toward its neighbours' mean, so the systematic inward drift that
    [`filter_laplacian`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_laplacian] has to correct for does not arise. A
    flat region is already a fixed point of both halves.

    Sharpen a surface by adding back the detail a smoothing pass removes.

    The inverse of a smoothing filter, built from one: the difference between the mesh and its
    Laplacian-smoothed self *is* its high-frequency content, so adding a multiple of that difference
    exaggerates every feature. This is **unsharp masking**, the photographic technique, applied to
    vertex positions instead of pixels — MeshLab spells it ``apply_coord_unsharp_mask`` — and it is
    the standard way to recover crispness lost to an earlier smoothing or a decimation.

    The name says what it returns, which is *positions* rather than a mask: the ``*_mask`` family
    in this package is boolean throughout.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions. Not modified.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    weight
        How much of the detail to add back. ``0`` leaves the mesh unchanged and large values amplify
        noise as readily as features. MeshLab's ``weight``, default ``0.3``.
    weight_original
        Multiplier on the original position, MeshLab's ``weightorig``. ``1`` (the default) keeps the
        surface where it is and only sharpens; anything else scales the whole mesh about the origin.
    iterations
        Laplacian passes used to define "smoothed", so this sets the *scale* of detail that gets
        amplified: more passes remove lower frequencies and therefore sharpen more coarsely.
        MeshLab's ``iterations``, default ``5``.
    laplacian_operator
        Optional precomputed operator, forwarded to
        [`filter_laplacian`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_laplacian].

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.vec3]
        Sharpened ``(n_vertices,)`` vertex positions on ``vertices.device``.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices`` and ``faces`` are not all on one device.

    Return the caller's row-stochastic operator, or the uniform-weight default built here.

    Every position filter here takes an optional prebuilt operator so a caller running several
    passes pays for the assembly once; this is the one place that decides what ``None`` means.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    laplacian_operator
        Prebuilt operator, or ``None`` to build the uniform-weight one.
    symmetric
        Build the undirected (symmetric) 1-ring operator instead of the directed default. Only
        [`filter_neighborhood_average`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_neighborhood_average] wants this,
        to match Open3D's ``adjacency_list`` at boundary vertices.

    Returns
    -------
    warp.sparse.BsrMatrix
        The operator to diffuse through.
