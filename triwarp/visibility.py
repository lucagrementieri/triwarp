"""
How far the surface is from a point.

Outward until nothing is hit ([`ambient_occlusion`][triwarp.visibility.ambient_occlusion],
[`volumetric_obscurance`][triwarp.visibility.volumetric_obscurance]); inward until it is hit again
([`shape_diameter`][triwarp.visibility.shape_diameter],
[`thickness`][triwarp.visibility.thickness]); or in every direction at once, which is the radius at
which the surface first appears
([`max_tangent_sphere`][triwarp.visibility.max_tangent_sphere]).

All five take ``(mesh: wp.Mesh, points, *, normals=None, ...)`` -- a prebuilt BVH and a set of
positions to measure at -- which is what separates this module from
[`triwarp.proximity`][triwarp.proximity], where the queries take raw ``(vertices, faces)`` and ask
*where* the surface is rather than how far away.

The two outward fields integrate the same bundle of rays over the outward hemisphere at each point,
weighted by Lambert's cosine law, and differ only in what a blocked ray costs: ambient occlusion
charges a hit its full weight however far away it is, obscurance discounts it by
``exp(-tau * distance)`` so that only nearby geometry darkens a point. Ambient occlusion is the
``tau -> 0`` limit, which is why they share a kernel. Neither is normalized against a scene, so both
are comparable across meshes and resolutions, and on a **convex** closed surface no ray can return
and every point reads exactly ``0`` -- the cheapest available sanity check on a result.

The three inward measures differ in how much evidence they take.
[`thickness`][triwarp.visibility.thickness] is a dispatcher over the other two: one inward ray, or
one tangent sphere. [`shape_diameter`][triwarp.visibility.shape_diameter] fires a whole cone and
takes an outlier-trimmed mean, which is what makes it stable enough for skeleton extraction and part
segmentation. [`max_tangent_sphere`][triwarp.visibility.max_tangent_sphere] uses no rays at all: it
shrinks a sphere until nothing but the surface touches it, so it answers the question for a *volume*
rather than along a direction, and it is the reason this module's name is a loose fit for one of its
five members.

    Fraction of the outward hemisphere at each point that is blocked by the mesh itself.

    A Fibonacci hemisphere lattice is rotated into each point's tangent frame and every direction is
    traced against the mesh; the result is the weighted share of directions that hit something. This
    is MeshLab's ``compute_scalar_ambient_occlusion`` and libigl's ``igl::ambient_occlusion``, which
    differ from each other exactly in the ``weight`` argument below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh
        Triangle mesh with a built BVH (``wp.Mesh``). The occluder *and* the surface being shaded.
    points
        ``(m,)`` positions to shade, normally the mesh's own vertices.
    normals
        ``(m,)`` outward unit normals, defining which hemisphere is "outward" at each point. When
        ``None`` they are taken from the closest face of ``mesh``
        ([`normals_at_closest_faces`][triwarp.proximity.normals_at_closest_faces]), which is right
        for points on the surface and meaningless for points far off it — pass them explicitly in
        that case. For a smooth result on the mesh's own vertices, pass
        [`vertex_normals`][triwarp.vertices.vertex_normals] at ``weighting="area"`` instead:
        face normals make the field piecewise constant across each vertex's ring.
    n_rays
        Directions per point. Error falls as ``1 / sqrt(n_rays)``; MeshLab's default is ``64``,
        which is this one. Cost is exactly linear in it.
    weight
        How a direction is weighted in the integral:

        - ``"cosine"`` (default) — by ``dot(direction, normal)``, which is the physically correct
          weighting for ambient irradiance and MeshLab's. Grazing directions barely matter.
        - ``"uniform"`` — every direction counts once, which is libigl's convention and reads as a
          solid-angle fraction rather than an irradiance one.
    max_t
        Maximum ray length. Anything beyond it does not occlude. When ``None``, the diagonal of the
        AABB enclosing the mesh and the query points, so nothing in the mesh is missed.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.float32]
        ``(m,)`` occlusion in ``[0, 1]`` on ``points.device``: ``0`` where the hemisphere is fully
        open and ``1`` where it is fully blocked. **Exactly ``0`` everywhere on a convex closed
        mesh**, which is the cheapest available sanity check on a result.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``n_rays < 1``, ``weight`` is not one of the two names, or ``normals`` has a different
        length from ``points``.

    Notes
    -----
    MeshLab reports the *complement* of this (higher is more exposed) and leaves it unnormalized —
    its number is roughly ``(1 - occlusion) * n_rays / 4`` for a cosine-weighted bundle over
    ``n_rays`` whole-sphere directions. Its direction set is also its own, so the two agree in
    distribution and in ranking rather than value by value.

    Parameters
    ----------

    n_rays
        Directions per point.
    tau
        Attenuation rate, in inverse length units of the mesh — so it is **not** scale-invariant,
        and a mesh scaled by ``k`` wants ``tau / k`` for the same result. MeshLab's default is
        ``0.1``, which suits a mesh of extent order 1. As ``tau -> 0`` this becomes
        [`ambient_occlusion`][triwarp.visibility.ambient_occlusion]; as ``tau -> inf`` everything
        reads ``0``. Must be positive.
    weight
        Ray weighting, as in [`ambient_occlusion`][triwarp.visibility.ambient_occlusion].
    max_t
        Maximum ray length.

    Returns
    -------

    Shape diameter function: local thickness of the volume, from an inward cone of rays.

    Shapira et al.'s SDF and MeshLab's ``compute_scalar_by_shape_diameter_function_per_vertex``. A
    cone of ``n_rays`` rays is fired *into* the volume about ``-normal``, each is traced to the far
    side, and the result is the cosine-weighted mean of those distances **after discarding the
    outliers** — the rays that escaped through a nearby opening or crossed the entire model, which
    would otherwise dominate the average near any concavity.

    This is the many-ray generalization of
    [`thickness(method="ray")`][triwarp.visibility.thickness]: at ``n_rays=1`` with a vanishing
    ``cone_angle`` the bundle collapses to the inward normal and the two agree to float32. The extra
    rays are what make it stable — a single ray through a thin sliver of geometry reads a thickness
    the neighbourhood does not have — and the reason it is the quantity used for skeleton extraction
    and part segmentation rather than the one-ray version.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh
        Triangle mesh with a built BVH (``wp.Mesh``). Should be closed: on an open surface the rays
        that find nothing on the far side are simply absent from the mean.
    points
        ``(m,)`` surface positions to measure at, normally the mesh's own vertices.
    normals
        ``(m,)`` **outward** unit normals; the cone opens along ``-normals``. When ``None`` they are
        taken from the closest face of ``mesh``. Pass
        [`vertex_normals`][triwarp.vertices.vertex_normals] at ``weighting="area"`` for a smooth
        field over a mesh's own vertices.
    n_rays
        Rays per point. MeshLab's default is ``64``, which is this one. Note that the single ray of
        ``n_rays=1`` is the *centroid* of the cone's Fibonacci lattice rather than its axis, so it
        only coincides with the inward normal as ``cone_angle`` goes to zero.
    cone_angle
        Half-angle of the cone in **radians**, measured from the inward normal. The default
        ``pi / 3`` (60 degrees) is Shapira's 120-degree cone. Must be in ``(0, pi / 2]`` — beyond
        that the cone reaches around to the outside of the surface and the distances stop meaning
        thickness.
    trim
        Keep only rays whose distance is within ``trim`` standard deviations of the mean before
        averaging. ``1.0`` (the default) is Shapira's rule; a large value keeps everything and turns
        this into a plain weighted mean. Must be non-negative.
    max_t
        Maximum ray length. When ``None``, the diagonal of the AABB enclosing the mesh and the query
        points.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.float32]
        ``(m,)`` diameters in the mesh's own length units on ``points.device``. ``inf`` at a point
        where no ray in the cone found the far side at all.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``n_rays < 1``, ``cone_angle`` is outside ``(0, pi / 2]``, ``trim < 0``, or ``normals``
        has a different length from ``points``.

    Notes
    -----
    MeshLab's ``cone_amplitude`` parameter is a **no-op** in the 2025.07 build — its output is
    byte-identical at ``90`` and ``120`` degrees — and its trimming rule is not the one documented
    in the paper, so its values differ from these by a roughly constant factor on a given mesh.
    Compare against it by rank rather than by value; the exactly-checkable statements are the
    reduction to [`thickness`][triwarp.visibility.thickness] at ``n_rays=1`` and the analytic
    ``2 R`` on a sphere.

    Per-point normals and the search radius every measure in this module needs.

    ``normals`` defaults to the closest face's normal, which is right for points on the surface and
    meaningless off it; the radius is the diagonal of the box enclosing both the mesh and the
    queries, so no ray or sphere is cut short.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh
        Triangle mesh with a built BVH (``wp.Mesh``).
    points
        ``(m,)`` positions being measured at.
    normals
        ``(m,)`` outward unit normals, or ``None`` to take them from the closest face.
    name
        Calling function's name, used in the error message.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[wp.array[wp.vec3], float]
        ``(normals, diagonal)``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``normals`` has a different length from ``points``.
