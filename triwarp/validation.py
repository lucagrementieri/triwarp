    """
    Whether every undirected mesh edge is shared by a manifold number of faces.

    Counts how many faces share each undirected edge. With ``allow_boundary_edges=True`` an edge is
    manifold when it belongs to one or two faces; with ``allow_boundary_edges=False`` it must belong
    to exactly two faces (no boundary or non-manifold edges), matching Open3D's ``IsEdgeManifold``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer.
    allow_boundary_edges
        When ``True`` (default) boundary edges (used by a single face) are allowed. When ``False``
        every edge must be shared by exactly two faces.
    edges_sorted
        Optional precomputed ``(n_faces * 3, 2)`` sorted edges in
        [`faces_to_edges`][triwarp.edges.faces_to_edges] row order. When ``None``, built from
        ``faces``.
    n_vertices
        Optional vertex count (the edge-hash base). When ``None`` and ``validate`` is ``True``,
        inferred from ``faces`` by the same reduction that checks them; unvalidated, no bound is
        needed and none is inferred.
    validate
        Whether to range-check the edge indices before packing them. The check is a
        ``triwarp.reduce.minmax`` whose host readback serialises the device pipeline. Pass
        ``False`` only where both bounds are structurally guaranteed -- a face buffer this package
        produced itself, or one an entry point has already validated.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        ``True`` when all edges satisfy the manifold condition. Vacuously ``True`` for an empty
        mesh.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``validate`` is ``True`` and a face index is negative or reaches the vertex count.
    RuntimeError
        If ``faces`` and ``edges_sorted`` are not all on one device.

    Whether every referenced vertex has a single edge-connected fan of faces.

    A vertex is manifold when the faces incident to it form one connected group under

    are non-manifold. Unreferenced vertices in ``[0, max(faces)]`` are treated as non-manifold,

    Parameters
    ----------
    faces

    face_adjacency

    face_adjacency_edges
        Optional ``(m, 2)`` shared-edge vertex pairs aligned with ``face_adjacency``
        (``return_edges=True``). Must be given together with ``face_adjacency``.
    n_vertices
        Optional length of the vertex buffer ``faces`` indexes, which must be at least
        ``max(faces) + 1`` and is not checked. It sizes the working tables only and does not change
        the answer: vertices past ``max(faces)`` are still not considered. When ``None``,
        ``max(faces) + 1`` is inferred with a device-host sync.

    Returns
    -------
    bool

    **The narrow phase runs in ``float64`` on the ``float32`` vertices**, and it is load-bearing

    for face against an independent ``float64`` Moller implementation over seven self-intersecting
    surfaces, it is exact on five, and on the other two it matches a second library and differs from
    the reference by at most four faces, every one of them a vertex lying *on* the other triangle's
    plane -- a tolerance choice rather than a fact. In ``float32`` the same audit read dozens of
    false positives and false negatives on one surface alone. It costs a few percent of the call.

    Where a comparison against another library is wanted on that tangency class, compare **counts,
    not sets**: which faces sit exactly on a tangency is the part no two implementations agree on.
    And a library whose loader repairs connectivity first may cut the orientation-reversing seam of
    a non-orientable surface, leaving two coincident sheets where the surface had one -- after which
    every face along the cut genuinely does intersect. Establish that the load changed nothing

    Flag faces that are thin, misoriented relative to their neighbourhood, or folded over it.

    The three criteria are independent and a face is flagged if *any* enabled one fires; each is
    disabled by passing ``None``. This is the detector behind
    [`repair.remove_folded_faces`][triwarp.repair.remove_folded_faces] -- unlike the rest of this
    module it needs geometry rather than topology, which is why it takes ``vertices`` and has no
    ``is_*`` counterpart: "defective" is a threshold question, not a property of the mesh.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer.
    min_quality
        Flag a face whose ``radius_ratio``
        ([`face_quality`][triwarp.triangles.face_quality]) is below this. ``0`` is fully degenerate
        and ``1`` is equilateral, so this is a *thinness* gate; MeshLab's ``aratio``, whose default
        of ``0.02`` is this one. ``None`` disables it.
    max_normal_angle
        Flag a face whose normal is more than this many **degrees** from the direction of the sum of
        its edge-neighbours' normals — the local consensus. This catches a single face inserted the
        wrong way round in an otherwise consistent patch. MeshLab's ``nfratio`` (default ``60``,
        off by default). ``None`` disables it.
    max_fold_angle
        Flag a face that meets *some* neighbour at more than this many **degrees** — a fold, where
        the two triangles lie almost on top of each other with opposing normals. Of the two faces at
        such an edge only the one facing *against* its own wider neighbourhood is flagged, since
        only one of them is the mistake; a face whose neighbours give it no consensus (an isolated
        face, or a strip of exactly three) is therefore never flagged on this criterion alone.
        MeshLab's ``folded_faces_angle_threshold`` (default ``160``, off by default). Must be in
        ``(0, 180]``. ``None`` disables it.
    face_normals
        Optional length-``n_faces`` unit face normals from
        [`face_normals_and_areas`][triwarp.triangles.face_normals_and_areas]; recomputed when
        ``None``. Only the two angle criteria read them, so this is the one geometry pass a caller
        already holding normals can skip.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.bool]
        Length-``n_faces`` mask on ``faces.device``; ``True`` marks a defective face. All-``False``
        when every criterion is disabled.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``max_normal_angle`` or ``max_fold_angle`` is outside ``(0, 180]``.
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices``, ``faces`` and ``face_normals`` are not all on one device.

    Notes
    -----
    Matches MeshLab's ``compute_selection_bad_faces``; the three parameters are its ``aratio``,
    ``nfratio`` and ``folded_faces_angle_threshold``.

    See Also
    --------
    [`repair.remove_folded_faces`][triwarp.repair.remove_folded_faces]
        Deletes the folded ones.
    [`Trimesh.face_normals`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.face_normals]
        Caches what ``face_normals`` wants.
    [`repair.remove_degenerate_faces`][triwarp.repair.remove_degenerate_faces]
        Deletes the fully degenerate ones, on an exact test rather than a threshold.
    [`triwarp.triangles.face_quality`][triwarp.triangles.face_quality]
        The thinness measure ``min_quality`` gates on.
