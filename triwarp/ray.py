    """
    Return world-space locations where rays hit the mesh surface (first hit per ray).

    Uses ``wp.mesh_query_ray`` on the mesh BVH. Ray directions are unitized before
    querying. Returns only rays that hit within ``max_t`` as sparse ``(m,)`` arrays,
    carrying the same set of hits as the dense output of
    [`intersects_first`][triwarp.ray.intersects_first].

    **Row order is unspecified.** Each hitting ray claims its output slot from an atomic
    counter, so rows arrive in the order the rays completed rather than in ray order, and two
    runs over the same input may order them differently. Sort by ``index_ray`` (or read
    [`intersects_first`][triwarp.ray.intersects_first] instead) when a stable order matters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh
        Triangle mesh with a built BVH (``wp.Mesh``).
    ray_origins
        ``(n,)`` ray origin positions as ``wp.vec3``.
    ray_directions
        ``(n,)`` ray direction vectors as ``wp.vec3`` (need not be unit length).
    max_t
        Optional maximum parametric distance along each normalized ray. When
        ``None``, derived from the combined mesh-and-origin AABB diagonal.

    Returns
    -------
    locations
        ``(m,)`` intersection points.
    index_ray
        ``(m,)`` index of the ray that produced each hit.

    """
    Test whether query points lie inside a closed mesh (ray parity sign).

    Uses ``wp.mesh_query_point_sign_parity`` on the mesh BVH, sharing the same
    parity path as
    [`signed_distance_on_mesh`][triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_on_mesh]. Points
    outside the mesh axis-aligned bounding box are rejected without a parity test.

    Triwarp mesh queries use **Warp's SDF sign convention** (outside positive,
    inside negative). A point is classified as inside when its signed distance
    would be negative; behavior on the on-surface tolerance band is undefined.
    Boolean results still match [`trimesh.Trimesh.contains`][].

    !!! note "Non-watertight meshes"

        Ray parity has no principled answer on an open or holed surface. For those, use the
        generalized winding-number sign instead:

        ```python
        from triwarp.kernels import array as kernel_array

        signed = tw.proximity.signed_distance_on_mesh(v, f, pts, sign_mode="winding")
        inside = wp.empty(signed.shape, dtype=wp.bool, device=signed.device)
        wp.map(kernel_array.less, signed, wp.float32(0.0), out=inside)
        ```

        That mode is deliberately **not** offered here. It needs a ``wp.Mesh`` built with
        ``support_winding_number=True``, and Warp neither records that flag on the mesh object nor
        errors when it is missing — it silently falls back to ray parity. Since this function takes
        a caller-supplied ``wp.Mesh``, triwarp cannot verify the flag, so the option would be able
        to quietly return the parity answer.
        [`signed_distance_on_mesh`][triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_on_mesh] builds its own mesh
        and therefore can guarantee it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh
        Triangle mesh with a built BVH (``wp.Mesh``).
    points
        ``(n,)`` query positions as ``wp.vec3``.
    n_sample
        Number of perturbed rays for parity voting (higher is more robust).
    perturbation_scale
        Uniform perturbation scale applied to the base ray direction.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.bool]
        ``(n,)`` flags; ``True`` when the point is classified as inside the mesh.

    Raises
    ------

        If ``mesh`` and ``points`` are not all on one device.
