"""
Homology generators: the loops that make a surface's topology, found by tree-cotree.

On a closed genus-``g`` surface there are ``2 * g`` independent loops that cannot be contracted to a
point — two per handle, going *around* it and *through* it. They are what a cutting tool needs (cut
along them and the surface opens into a disk), and what tells a parametrizer where its seams have to
go.

The construction is Erickson & Whittlesey's tree-cotree decomposition, and it is a counting
argument as much as an algorithm: take a spanning tree of the vertex graph, then a spanning tree of
the *dual* graph that avoids the primal tree's edges, and every remaining edge closes exactly one
independent loop. Euler's formula fixes how many are left: ``E - (V - 1) - (F - 1) = 2 - chi``,
which is ``2 * g``.

Unlike the rest of this package there is no reference implementation to compare against —
potpourri3d does not expose geometry-central's homology code — so the tests check structural
invariants instead: the loop count against
[`euler_characteristic`][triwarp.measures.euler_characteristic], and that every loop is a closed
walk along real mesh edges that visits no vertex twice.

    """
    Non-contractible loops of the surface, as ordered vertex-index cycles.

    Returns ``2 * g`` loops for a closed genus-``g`` surface and none for a sphere. Each loop is a
    closed walk along mesh edges: consecutive entries share an edge, and so do the last and first
    (the start vertex is not repeated, matching
    [`boundary_loops`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops]).

    The loops are a *basis*, not canonical: any generating set is as valid as any other, and this
    one falls out of the spanning trees the construction happens to build. They are also as long
    and as jagged as those trees, which is what
    [`shorten_loop`][triwarp.geodesic_walk.shorten_loop] is for. The basis is **reproducible**, and
    the same on every device: the primal tree resolves competing claims by lowest vertex index and
    the dual forest by lowest edge index, so neither depends on the order the threads ran in.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions. Only the count is used.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer. Must be a closed, connected,
        edge-manifold surface: the counting argument this rests on assumes it.
    copy
        Return independent buffers instead of views into one packed allocation.

    Returns
    -------
    list[wp.array[wp.int32]]
        One ``wp.int32`` array of vertex indices per generator, on ``faces.device``. Empty for a
        sphere, and for a mesh with no faces.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the mesh has a boundary, since a surface with boundary has a different homology basis
        (every boundary loop contributes one, and the tree-cotree count no longer applies), or if
        its referenced vertices are not all in one connected component, since the count is then a
        sum over components that a single pair of spanning trees does not produce.
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices`` and ``faces`` are not all on one device.

    **The root is the lowest-indexed *referenced* vertex, read on the device rather than handed in**
