"""
Implicit halfedge connectivity: edge twins and counter-clockwise vertex one-rings.

There is no halfedge *structure* here, only an indexing convention over the flat face buffer every
other module already uses. Halfedge ``h = 3 * f + k`` runs from ``faces[3f + k]`` to
``faces[3f + (k + 1) % 3]``, so ``next`` and ``prev`` are index arithmetic and the halfedges of a
face are consecutive. Exactly two arrays are needed to navigate a mesh:
[`halfedge_twins`][triwarp.halfedge.halfedge_twins] to cross an edge, and
[`vertex_one_rings`][triwarp.halfedge.vertex_one_rings] to rotate around a vertex.

This is the ordering the tangent-space machinery in [`triwarp.tangent_space`][triwarp.tangent_space]
is built on: a rotational order of the outgoing halfedges at a vertex is what turns per-corner
angles into a polar coordinate system on the tangent plane.

) -> wp.array[wp.int32]:
    """
    Opposite halfedge of every halfedge, or ``-1`` on a boundary.

    Halfedges ``h = 3 * f + k`` and ``twins[h]`` traverse the same undirected edge in opposite
    directions, so ``twins[twins[h]] == h`` wherever ``twins[h] != -1``. The halfedges left at
    ``-1`` are exactly the mesh boundary, in the orientation
    [`oriented_boundary_edges`][triwarp.boundary.oriented_boundary_edges] reports.

    The *opposite directions* half of that is a precondition on the mesh and not merely a property
    of the output: it holds only where the two faces meeting at an edge are wound consistently, so
    an inconsistently wound or non-orientable mesh is rejected rather than paired up. Every
    consumer of this table -- the counter-clockwise rotation
    [`vertex_one_rings`][triwarp.halfedge.vertex_one_rings] walks above all -- reads a twin as "the
    same edge, seen from the other side", and there is no other side to see when both halfedges
    face the same way.

    Undirected edges are matched by packing each sorted endpoint pair into one key
    ([`hash_indices_rows`][triwarp.grouping.hash_indices_rows]), radix-sorting the keys with the
    halfedge index as payload, and pairing up the runs of equal keys — the same mechanism behind
    [`edges_unique`][triwarp.edges.edges_unique] and
    [`face_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.face_adjacency], without materializing the unique edge
    list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    n_vertices
        Total vertex count. It is only ever the key radix here, so passing it is an optimization
        rather than a requirement: when ``None`` the keys pack against
        [`constants.INDEX_RADIX_PAIR`][triwarp.constants.INDEX_RADIX_PAIR], which bounds every
        ``int32`` index without a reduction and orders the keys the same way.
    validate
        When ``True`` (the default), reject the two meshes below. ``False`` skips the check and
        the synchronization it costs, for a caller that knows ``faces`` is edge-manifold and
        consistently wound -- one that built it from a buffer already validated here by an
        operation that preserves both; on a mesh that is neither the table is garbage.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.int32]
        Length ``3 * n_faces`` on ``faces.device``; ``-1`` for boundary halfedges.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If an undirected edge carries three or more halfedges (an edge-non-manifold mesh, where
        "the" opposite halfedge is not defined), or if both halfedges of an edge traverse it in the
        *same* direction, which is what an inconsistently wound or non-orientable mesh looks like
        from here and which leaves the "opposite directions" guarantee above with nothing to mean.
        Detecting either needs one 8-byte readback, so under ``validate`` this function
        synchronizes once.

    Raise unless a precomputed twin table really is one for ``faces``.

    The contract behind every ``twins=`` keyword in the package, checked in both of its halves. The
    table is indexed *by halfedge* (``h = 3 * f + k``), so it is meaningful only for the face buffer
    it was built from: a table cached from a smaller mesh is not merely stale -- it is short, and
    the kernels that walk it index past its end, which on the CPU device reads the host heap rather
    than raising. And each entry must be the *opposite* halfedge, since that is what every consumer
    reads it as -- the counter-clockwise rotation
    [`vertex_one_rings`][triwarp.halfedge.vertex_one_rings] walks, the transport angle
    [`triwarp.tangent_space`][triwarp.tangent_space] pairs across an edge, and the dual edge
    [`triwarp.selection`][triwarp.selection] floods through. Public because those callers live in
    three modules and must all reject the same table the same way; only the first reaches the
    rotation, so a check placed in that walk would leave the other two unguarded.

    What it checks is every entry that *is* present; what it cannot check is an entry that is
    absent. A ``-1`` claims "this halfedge has no twin", and deciding whether that is true means
    finding out whether another halfedge spans the same edge -- which is the sort
    [`halfedge_twins`][triwarp.halfedge.halfedge_twins] does and the work ``twins=`` exists to skip,
    so demanding it here would make the keyword pointless. A table of nothing but ``-1`` therefore
    passes; it is not silent, because a fabricated boundary shortens the fan and
    [`vertex_one_rings`][triwarp.halfedge.vertex_one_rings] then raises on the ring it could not
    complete.

    The length half is free. The structural half costs one launch over the halfedges and one
    readback, and is only ever paid when a table was actually supplied -- the path a caller takes to
    skip an edge build, a hash, a radix sort, a launch and a readback, so verifying the shortcut
    stays a fraction of what taking it saved. A table this package produced can never fail it, since
    ``halfedge_twins`` establishes the property by construction.

    The device half of the same contract is the caller's own ``require_same_device`` call, which
    covers every argument it received rather than this pair alone.

    Parameters
    ----------
    faces

    """
    Outgoing halfedges of every vertex in counter-clockwise order, as a CSR buffer.

    Returned values first and offsets second, the package's packed-buffer convention -- see
    [`array.pack_1d_arrays`][triwarp.array.pack_1d_arrays], which states it.

    Vertex ``v`` owns ``ring_halfedges[offsets[v] : offsets[v + 1]]``, each entry a halfedge leaving
    ``v``; the ring size is therefore the number of incident *faces*, one less than the number of
    adjacent vertices at a boundary vertex. Consecutive entries are consecutive around ``v`` in the
    direction the face orientation calls counter-clockwise, because the rotation ``h ->
    twins[prev(h)]`` steps from edge ``v -> a`` to edge ``v -> b`` inside the CCW-oriented face
    ``(v, a, b)``.

    A boundary vertex starts its ring at its outgoing boundary halfedge (the clockwise-most edge of
    its fan) so the whole fan is enumerated; interior vertices start at their lowest-indexed
    outgoing halfedge, which makes the rotational *order* canonical but its starting point
    arbitrary. Isolated vertices get an empty row.

    Parameters
    ----------
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    twins
        Optional precomputed [`halfedge_twins`][triwarp.halfedge.halfedge_twins]. When ``None`` it
        is computed here.
    n_vertices
        Total vertex count (the number of CSR rows). When ``None`` it is inferred with
        [`array.index_bound`][triwarp.array.index_bound], which costs a host readback.
    validate
        When ``True`` (the default), reject a pinched vertex, and forward the same choice to
        [`halfedge_twins`][triwarp.halfedge.halfedge_twins] when ``twins`` is computed here.
        ``False`` skips both checks and their synchronizations, for a caller that knows ``faces``
        is manifold and consistently wound.

    Returns
    -------
    ring_halfedges : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Length ``3 * n_faces`` outgoing halfedges, grouped and ordered per vertex.
    offsets : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Length ``n_vertices + 1`` CSR row starts; ``offsets[-1] == 3 * n_faces``.
    is_boundary : wp.array[wp.bool]
        Length ``n_vertices``; ``True`` where the vertex is incident to a boundary edge.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``twins`` is given and is not a twin table for ``faces``
        ([`require_matching_twins`][triwarp.halfedge.require_matching_twins] states what that
        means), or if a vertex's rotation closes before its whole fan is covered — a pinched,
        vertex-non-manifold vertex where two fans meet at a single index, under ``validate``.
        Detecting the latter needs one 4-byte readback, so under ``validate`` this function
        synchronizes once.
