"""
Cross-sections and level sets: where a mesh meets a plane, another mesh, or an isovalue.

A plane section and an isocontour are the same operation seen twice: intersecting a mesh with a
plane is exactly extracting the zero level set of that plane's signed distance. So
[`mesh_with_plane`][triwarp.intersection.mesh_with_plane] and
[`marching_triangles`][triwarp.intersection.marching_triangles] sit side by side here — the first
takes the field implicitly as a plane, the second takes any per-vertex scalar field — and both emit
the [`triwarp.polyline`][triwarp.polyline] convention: one array of points per curve, closed curves
not repeating their first point, and a parallel list of closed flags.

[`mesh_with_mesh`][triwarp.intersection.mesh_with_mesh] is the genuine intersection in the set
sense, and [`slice_mesh_with_plane`][triwarp.intersection.slice_mesh_with_plane] keeps the cut
geometry rather than the curve.

Every entry point here that takes a plane takes it as ``(plane_normal, plane_origin)``, in that
order, and so does every plane argument elsewhere in the package. Both are ``wp.vec3``, so a
transposed call type-checks and sections the wrong plane -- pass them by keyword where the call site
is not obvious. [`points.fit_plane`][triwarp.points.fit_plane] returns the pair in this order, so
its result splats straight into any of them.

    """
    Extract the ``values == isovalue`` level set as a list of polylines.

    Each returned curve is a connected component of the level set, oriented so that the region where
    ``values > isovalue`` lies to its left (with the vertex normals as up). Curves close up unless
    they run into a mesh boundary, so an open curve begins and ends on a boundary edge.

    A value equal to the isovalue counts as positive, which keeps every cut face at exactly one
    segment; a contour running exactly through a vertex therefore yields zero-length segments rather
    than an ambiguous junction.

    Crossings are matched by the vertex pair of the edge they lie on, then
    linked on the host: the segment list is compacted on device first, so the readback is one
    ``int32`` pair per segment, and the linking itself is a vectorized pointer-doubling ranking over
    the compacted arrays with no per-segment iteration (the same successor-graph shape
    [`boundary_loops`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops] solves on device).

    !!! note "The returned arrays are views"
        Every curve slices one packed buffer, so holding a single curve keeps them all alive and
        writing into one writes into the shared allocation. ``wp.clone`` a curve for an independent
        buffer.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    values
        ``(n_vertices,)`` scalar field, ``wp.float32`` or ``wp.float64``. A ``float64`` field (what
        [`heat_geodesic`][triwarp.heat.heat_geodesic] returns) is interpolated in
        ``float64``.
    isovalue
        Level to extract.
    n_vertices
        Total vertex count, used as the base that packs a crossed edge's two vertex indices into
        the key matching it across the two faces that share it. When ``None`` the length of
        ``vertices`` is used, which bounds every index the faces may reference.

    Returns
    -------
    curves : list[wp.array[wp.vec3]]
        One array of points per level-set component, in order along the curve, on
        ``vertices.device``. Closed curves do not repeat their first point.
    closed : list[bool]
        Whether each curve is a closed loop.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If two segments start on the same mesh edge, which means the faces are not consistently

    Which faces of two meshes cross each other, as index pairs.

    The **collision** question, as against

    "do these two touch, and where" without computing the geometry of the contact, which is what a
    contact resolver, a fit check or an assembly validator wants.
    [`triwarp.validation.face_self_intersecting_mask`][triwarp.validation.face_self_intersecting_mask]
    is the same question asked of one mesh against itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices_a, faces_a
        First mesh: ``(n_vertices_a,)`` positions and a length-``3 * n_faces_a`` index buffer.
    vertices_b, faces_b
        Second mesh, in the same form.
    max_triangle_collisions
        Broad-phase candidate cap per query triangle. A pair beyond the cap is **dropped**, so raise
        it on meshes whose triangles pile into overlapping boxes; the answer is a subset, never a
        superset.

    Returns
    -------
    twt.Array2dInt32
        ``(n_pairs, 2)`` face-index pairs, column 0 into ``faces_a`` and column 1 into ``faces_b``.
        Empty ``(0, 2)`` when the meshes do not cross. Pairs that merely touch or are coplanar are
        **not** collisions -- the same convention
        [`triwarp.validation.is_self_intersecting`][triwarp.validation.is_self_intersecting] uses.
        A pair whose triangles share an exact vertex position is one case of "touch" and is
        excluded unconditionally, even where the two triangles otherwise cross through each other's
        interior away from that vertex -- this is what keeps two meshes glued along a common seam
        (or one watertight mesh split into pieces) from reporting every shared-edge face pair as a
        collision.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``max_triangle_collisions`` is less than 1.

    Notes
    -----
    The plane's signed distance is one per-vertex scalar field, so this is
    [`clip_mesh_with_field`][triwarp.intersection.clip_mesh_with_field] over
    ``dot(v - plane_origin, plane_normal)`` — the only thing the plane adds is the tie-break for a
    face lying *in* the plane, whose side is decided from its own normal rather than from its
    vertices.

    Every face falls into exactly one of three kept classes — wholly inside, cut into a quad, cut
    into a triangle — and the three are compacted by a *single* scan over one blocked flag buffer,
    so the call makes one host readback (the three class counts) rather than one per class. Those
    counts then size the output buffers for their final use, and the two cut kernels write their
    triangles and their intersection points straight into them, so nothing is concatenated
    afterwards. The cost barely tracks the face count, since the plane still meets only
    ``O(sqrt(n_faces))`` triangles.

    Insert a plane's cross-section into the mesh as real edges, keeping both sides.

    The third thing a plane can do to a mesh, next to
    [`mesh_with_plane`][triwarp.intersection.mesh_with_plane], which returns the section curve and
    leaves the mesh alone, and
    [`slice_mesh_with_plane`][triwarp.intersection.slice_mesh_with_plane], which keeps one side and
    discards the other: this keeps **everything** and refines the triangles the plane crosses so the
    section becomes a set of mesh edges, then labels every output face by the side it fell on. It is
    what to reach for to select a region by a plane and then remesh, decimate or smooth only that
    region, since the complementary side is still there to be welded back to.

    The result is **crack-free**: the crossing point of an edge is computed once per *edge*, so the
    two triangles sharing it reference one vertex index and a watertight input stays watertight.
    That is the difference from
    [`slice_mesh_with_plane`][triwarp.intersection.slice_mesh_with_plane], whose per-face cut leaves
    two coincident copies along the section.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` flat triangle index buffer.
    plane_normal
        Normal vector of the plane. Need not be unit length, but ``tolerance`` is a band on
        ``dot(v - plane_origin, plane_normal)``, so a non-unit normal scales it.
    plane_origin
        Point on the plane.
    tolerance
        Half-width of the band around the plane within which a vertex counts as lying *on* it. Such
        a vertex is used as the crossing itself rather than having a near-duplicate inserted beside
        it, which is what keeps a plane through an existing vertex from producing slivers. Defaults
        to [`TOLERANCE_MERGE`][triwarp.constants.TOLERANCE_MERGE]; scale it with the model when the
        coordinates are large.

    Returns
    -------
    new_vertices : wp.array[wp.vec3]
        Original vertices followed by one crossing point per crossed edge.
    new_faces : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Length-``3 * m`` flat triangle index buffer for the refined mesh, both sides included.
    above : wp.array[wp.bool]
        ``(m,)`` per-face mask: ``True`` where the face is on the ``plane_normal`` side. This is the
        side [`slice_mesh_with_plane`][triwarp.intersection.slice_mesh_with_plane] returns,
        including its tie-break for a face lying *in* the plane (kept when its own normal opposes
        ``plane_normal``), so
        ``submesh_from_face_mask(*split_mesh_with_plane(...))`` and ``slice_mesh_with_plane`` agree
        — with one exception: a face lying in the plane whose own area is degenerate (below
        [`TOLERANCE_MERGE`][triwarp.constants.TOLERANCE_MERGE]-scale zero) has no normal to break
        the tie with, so [`slice_mesh_with_plane`][triwarp.intersection.slice_mesh_with_plane] drops
        it from the output entirely, on either side, while this function — which keeps every face
        somewhere — assigns it to ``True`` by convention.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices`` and ``faces`` are not all on one device.

    Notes
    -----
    A plane crosses at most **two** of a triangle's three edges — two of three vertices always share
    a side, so their edge is not crossed — which means every crossed face is refined by the 1-split
    or 2-split case of [`subdivide_to_size`][triwarp.remesh.subdivide_to_size]'s crack-free
    templates, reused unchanged. Those templates are indexed by *which* corners carry a new vertex
    and never assume the new vertex is a midpoint, so the plane crossing drops straight in. The
    2-split quad is cut along its shorter diagonal, as there; both of its diagonals lie wholly on
    one side of the plane, so the choice cannot make a face straddle.

    Faces are **not** reordered: an output face's position is the compaction order of the split
    templates, not grouped by side. Pass ``above`` to
    [`submesh_from_face_mask`][triwarp.selection.submesh_from_face_mask] (or its negation) to
    materialize either half.

    Equivalent to VTK's ``vtkClipPolyData`` with ``GenerateClippedOutput``, which pyvista exposes as
    ``PolyData.clip(..., return_clipped=True)``.

    """
    Keep the ``values >= isovalue`` region of the mesh, cutting faces the level set crosses.

    The region counterpart of
    [`marching_triangles`][triwarp.intersection.marching_triangles], which returns the level set
    itself: this returns the surface on one side of it, with every crossed triangle re-triangulated
    against the crossing points. The caller supplies the field, so one implementation covers
    clipping by a plane, by another surface's signed distance
    ([`signed_distance_on_mesh`][triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_on_mesh]), by a box, by geodesic
    distance ([`heat_geodesic`][triwarp.heat.heat_geodesic]) or by any per-vertex quantity
    the caller can threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` flat triangle index buffer.
    values
        ``(n_vertices,)`` scalar field, ``wp.float32`` or ``wp.float64``. A ``float64`` field is
        shifted in ``float64`` and then compared in ``float32``, which is the vertex buffer's
        precision.
    isovalue
        Level to clip at. A vertex whose value equals it counts as kept, matching
        [`marching_triangles`][triwarp.intersection.marching_triangles].
    cap
        When ``True``, weld the section rim and seal **every** boundary loop of the result with
        [`fill_min_weight`][triwarp.holes.fill_min_weight] — so a closed input gives a closed
        output, and the returned vertices are the welded ones. On an input that already had a
        boundary, that boundary is sealed too; clip first and cap yourself with
        [`fill_loops_min_weight`][triwarp.holes.fill_loops_min_weight] if only the section should
        close.

    Returns
    -------
    new_vertices
        Vertices of the clipped region, with the crossing points appended.
    new_faces
        Length-``3 * m`` flat triangle index buffer for the clipped region.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices``, ``faces`` and ``values`` are not all on one device.

    Notes
    -----
    A face whose three values all equal ``isovalue`` is dropped: it lies *in* the level set, so
    neither side claims it and the field gives no tie-break.
    [`slice_mesh_with_plane`][triwarp.intersection.slice_mesh_with_plane] is the one caller that has
    one, and keeps such a face when its normal opposes the plane's.

    The uncapped result is **cracked along the section**, like
    [`trimesh.intersections.slice_faces_plane`][]'s: each cut face writes its own copy of the
    crossing points, so a rim edge carries two coincident vertices. Those copies are bitwise equal
    by construction, which is what makes ``cap=True``'s weld exact rather than a tolerance choice.

    Equivalent to VTK's ``clip_scalar`` (uncapped) and ``clip_closed_surface`` (capped, over a
    plane's signed distance), which pyvista exposes on ``PolyData``; VTK's default keeps
    ``scalar >= value`` as this does.

    Examples
    --------
    Keep the geodesic disk of radius 1 around vertex 0, sealed into a solid. The field is the
    ``float64`` one [`heat_geodesic`][triwarp.heat.heat_geodesic] returns, and the region
    wanted is the *near* side, so the field enters negated:

    ```python
    source = wp.array([0], dtype=wp.int32, device=v.device)
    distance = tw.heat.heat_geodesic(v, f, source)
    negated = wp.empty_like(distance)
    wp.map(wp.neg, distance, out=negated)
    disk_v, disk_f = tw.intersection.clip_mesh_with_field(v, f, negated, -1.0, cap=True)
    print(tw.validation.is_edge_manifold(disk_f, allow_boundary_edges=False))

    """
    Cut every face the level set crosses, keeping **both** sides as one connected mesh.

    The both-sides form of [`clip_mesh_with_field`][triwarp.intersection.clip_mesh_with_field]: that
    one keeps the ``values >= isovalue`` region and discards the rest, this one keeps everything and
    makes the level set a set of real mesh edges. Nothing moves and nothing is welded -- every input
    vertex survives at its own position, and the crossing points are appended and **shared** by the
    faces on both sides, so the result is as watertight as the input was.

    That sharing is the whole point. It is what makes the returned mask a genuine partition of the
    surface along the curve rather than two overlapping selections, so
    [`submesh_from_face_mask`][triwarp.selection.submesh_from_face_mask] on the mask and on its
    negation gives two pieces that meet exactly along the level set.

    A face with one corner exactly on the level set splits into **two** triangles, not three: the
    cut runs from that corner to the single crossing on the opposite edge. Emitting three would put
    a zero-area sliver in the output.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` flat triangle index buffer.
    values
        ``(n_vertices,)`` scalar field, ``wp.float32`` or ``wp.float64``. A ``float64`` field is
        shifted in ``float64`` and then compared in ``float32``, which is the vertex buffer's
        precision -- the same rule as
        [`marching_triangles`][triwarp.intersection.marching_triangles].
    isovalue
        Level to cut at. A vertex whose value equals it counts as positive, so a face lying wholly
        in the level set is kept whole on the positive side rather than cut along itself.

    Returns
    -------
    new_vertices : wp.array[wp.vec3]
        The input vertices, unchanged and in order, with the crossing points appended.
    new_faces : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Length-``3 * m`` flat triangle index buffer. Uncut faces keep their winding and their
        vertex indices; cut faces are replaced by the two or three triangles they split into.
    positive : wp.array[wp.bool]
        Length-``m`` mask, ``True`` for the faces on the ``values >= isovalue`` side.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
