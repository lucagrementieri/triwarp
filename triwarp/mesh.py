# neighbours the projection is exactly zero, so the tiny perturbation a rotation introduces

# `vertex_tangent_frames` is here rather than one rung up because the gauge is a set of *unit*
# tangent directions: the reference halfedge scales, the projection into the tangent plane scales

# an isometry does. It is the one entry in this set that `transform` **rotates** rather than
# carrying verbatim (see the header's note and `_carry_directions`), and membership here is
# load-bearing twice over: it is also what subjects the frame to the `_ORIENTATION_DEPENDENT_KEYS`
# subtraction, which a mirror needs -- a reflected frame's `basis_x` is nowhere near the recomputed
# one, where the *normal* still agrees because `transform_normals` maps it by the inverse

# `face_adjacency_projections` is in no set either, and not because it fails to survive an
# isometry -- it carries through cleanly. It is dropped so it cannot contradict
# `face_adjacency_convex`, which is exactly `projections <= TOLERANCE_MERGE` and is *not*
# carryable for the threshold reason above. Carrying one while recomputing the other lets a
# transformed mesh report a projection next to a `convex` that disagrees with it, on precisely the
# coplanar meshes where the threshold is fragile: one rotation of `cave_cube` leaves pairs within
# nanometres of the `1e-8` threshold band. The pair is cheap -- one kernel over the adjacency
# rows -- so recomputing both keeps them consistent for less than the bug is worth.

# The mass properties -- `volume`, `center_mass`, `moment_inertia` -- are in **no** set, and the
# reason is not the obvious one. Each is an integral over the tetrahedra from the origin to every
# face, which telescopes to an origin-independent answer only when the surface is *closed*. On an
# open mesh they are origin-dependent, so a translation changes all three, where the same move on a
# closed surface leaves them alone to float32 rounding. Carrying them would need the stratum
# to depend on `is_watertight`, which is a device readback and a second axis through every set;
# recomputing them is three readbacks and always right.

# A translation moves no direction at all, so normals, frames and the operator bundles built from
# them survive untouched -- the one rung where nothing has to be recomputed *or* rotated. The
# bounding box survives too, and `transform` shifts it on the host rather than reducing again.
#
# `vertex_tangent_frames` is *not* relisted here: it comes in through `_SIMILARITY_CARRY`, and a

class Trimesh:
    """
    A triangle mesh with lazily cached derived quantities.

    Holds a ``vertices``/``faces`` pair (the same flat-``int32`` convention used throughout
    `triwarp`) and computes derived geometry, topology and validity predicates on first access,
    caching the result. `Trimesh` is frozen: there are no setters, so a cached value can never
    silently go stale from a Python-level mutation. The ``warp.Mesh`` BVH is held by composition
    rather than inheritance and built lazily behind [`warp_mesh`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.warp_mesh],
    since building it eagerly would waste GPU memory on meshes that never issue a ray or proximity
    query.

    Every cached property returns the same object on each access -- an array, a tuple of arrays or a
    sparse matrix, aliased across repeated accesses and (for `warp_mesh`) with the mesh's own
    `vertices`/`faces` buffers -- so callers must not mutate a returned buffer in place. That
    matters most where they are passed *into* the free functions as precomputed arguments: a wrapper
    that rewrites such a buffer copies it first. If a buffer is deliberately mutated in place by a
    kernel, call [`invalidate`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.invalidate] afterward to drop every cached
    value (including the BVH); otherwise use [`with_vertices`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.with_vertices] /
    [`with_faces`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.with_faces], which return a new `Trimesh` and carry forward
    whichever cached values are still valid.

    Scalar-valued properties (`area`, `centroid`, `bounds`, `enclosing_diagonal`,
    `mean_edge_length`, `euler_characteristic`, and every `is_*` predicate) synchronize from device
    to host on first access; the synchronized Python value is then cached like any other.

    Most of these are also what the free functions accept as an optional precomputed argument, so
    the cache is worth more than the repeat accesses on this class: pass `edges_sorted`,
    `face_adjacency`, `halfedge_twins`, `vertex_one_rings`, `vertex_face_adjacency`, `face_normals`
    / `face_areas`, `cotmatrix_entries`, `bounds`, `laplacian_operator` or an operator bundle into
    the wrapper that takes it and the whole assembly is skipped. The discrete operators at the
    bottom of the class (`cotmatrix` through `vector_heat_operators`) are the heaviest of these and
    the reason a solver run over one mesh should go through a `Trimesh`. Caching pays off most when
    the same mesh is reused across many calls, and least where a single solve dominates the cost of
    any one call.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Triangle indices as ``wp.int32``, either flat (length ``3 * n_faces``) or shape
        ``(n_faces, 3)`` (flattened on construction).
    initial_cache
        Optional pre-populated cache entries, keyed by property name. Used by
        [`from_warp_mesh`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.from_warp_mesh] to seed `warp_mesh` without
        rebuilding its BVH, and by
        [`with_vertices`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.with_vertices] to carry forward
        topology-only caches.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If ``vertices`` is not a rank-1 ``wp.vec3`` array, or ``faces`` is not rank-1 or
        rank-2 ``wp.int32`` after flattening.
    ValueError
        If a rank-2 ``faces`` array does not have shape ``(n_faces, 3)``, or the flattened
        face buffer's size is not a multiple of 3.

    Examples
    --------

    mesh = tw.Trimesh.from_warp_mesh(warp_mesh)

    mesh.face_areas  # already cached as a by-product of face_normals

        """
        Return a new `Trimesh` under an affine transform, carrying forward whatever survives it.

        `Trimesh` is frozen, so this returns a new instance rather than moving this one -- and that
        is the *fast* path, not merely the safe one. How much of the cache survives is decided by
        what the transform preserves ([`classify_transform`][triwarp.transform.classify_transform]),
        and for a rigid motion that is everything expensive: angles, areas, the cotangent table and
        the assembled [`cotmatrix`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.cotmatrix] are all isometry invariants, so
        only the directions and the bounding box are touched.

        | transform | recomputed on the new mesh |
        |---|---|
        | translation | the BVH, and nothing else |
        | rigid, reflection | the BVH and `bounds`; directions are *rotated*, not rebuilt |
        | similarity | the above, plus the length and area quantities |
        | affine | everything but connectivity |

        Face winding is reversed when ``matrix`` mirrors, which keeps normals outward and costs the
        orientation-dependent caches on top of the row above --
        [`vertex_one_rings`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.vertex_one_rings], the directed edge tables and
        the per-corner tables among them.

        Carrying the cache forward is cheaper than transforming the buffers and rebuilding a
        `Trimesh` around them whenever the mesh is reused for further queries: the saving is a count
        of assembly launches skipped, so it is worth reaching for on a mesh carried through a
        sequence of poses, and worth little on a mesh transformed once and used once.

        Parameters
        ----------
        matrix
            ``4x4`` transform, as a scalar ``wp.mat44`` or a ``(1,)`` ``wp.array[wp.mat44]`` --
            an [`icp`][triwarp.registration.icp] result can be passed straight through. Build one
            with [`translation_matrix`][triwarp.transform.translation_matrix],
            [`rotation_matrix`][triwarp.transform.rotation_matrix],
            [`scale_matrix`][triwarp.transform.scale_matrix] or
            [`reflection_matrix`][triwarp.transform.reflection_matrix].
        assume
            A [`TransformKind`][triwarp.transform.TransformKind] value promising what ``matrix``
            preserves, skipping the classification. Use it when a matrix composed from many
            ``float32`` factors has drifted far enough off orthogonality to be classified
            `TransformKind.AFFINE`, which is safe but discards the cache. **An incorrect promise
            silently corrupts every carried value** -- there is no check.

        Returns
        -------
        Trimesh
            New instance on the transformed vertices, sharing whatever cached values survive.
            ``self`` when ``matrix`` is the identity.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If ``assume`` is not a `TransformKind` value.

        Notes
        -----
        Carried values are **aliased**, not copied, exactly as with
        [`with_vertices`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.with_vertices]: the returned mesh and this one hold
        the same array objects. That is safe because neither can mutate them, and it is why this
        class offers no in-place transform -- an edit to a shared buffer would corrupt every mesh
        derived from it, with nothing to invalidate them. Use
        [`transform_points`][triwarp.transform.transform_points] with ``out=`` for in-place work on
        raw buffers.

        Examples
        --------

        ----------
        other
            Mesh to append; its vertices follow this mesh's in the result.

        Returns
        -------
        Trimesh
            Combined mesh with an empty cache. Vertices are **not** merged, so a shared surface
            stays two coincident sheets -- [`triwarp.repair.remove_duplicated_vertices`][] is the
            weld.

        See Also
        --------
        [`triwarp.combine.concatenate`][]
        [`split`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.split]
            The inverse, up to ordering.
        ``trimesh.Trimesh.__add__``
            The same operator under trimesh's name for it (no Sphinx inventory entry to link).

        Clear every cached value, including the `warp_mesh` BVH.

        Call this after mutating `vertices` or `faces` in place from a kernel — `Trimesh` has
        no way to detect such an edit on its own, so cached values would otherwise silently
        go stale.
