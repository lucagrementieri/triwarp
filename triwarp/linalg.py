"""
Sparse linear-algebra helpers shared by the parametrization and smoothing solvers.

Two layers:

- [`min_quad_with_fixed`][triwarp.linalg.min_quad_with_fixed] and its two steps
  ([`free_partition`][triwarp.linalg.free_partition],
  [`assemble_interior_system`][triwarp.linalg.assemble_interior_system]) port
  ``igl::min_quad_with_fixed``: minimize a quadratic form with some degrees of freedom pinned, by
  eliminating the fixed rows/columns into a reduced symmetric system.
- [`solve_spd_columns`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd_columns] and
  [`spd_column_solver`][triwarp.linalg.spd_column_solver] solve one symmetric positive-definite
  operator against several right-hand-side columns in a *single* conjugate-gradient call.

**Why batch the columns.** Solving a ``k``-column system as a Python loop of ``k`` independent
``cg`` calls costs the ``sum`` of the per-column iteration counts, and every CG iteration then
launches ``k`` separate sets of reduction and AXPY kernels.
[`replicated_operator`][triwarp.linalg.replicated_operator] instead presents the *same* operator as
``k`` independent subproblems over one flat ``k * n`` vector: the solver advances all columns
together and stops on the worst-case residual, so the cost becomes ``max`` of the per-column
iteration counts with one set of vector kernels per iteration. The sparse matrix is never replicated
in memory -- the ``matvec`` issues ``k`` ``bsr_mv`` calls against the single operator.

**Whose conjugate gradient.** Every scalar ``float64`` solve runs this module's own ``_BatchedCg``
-- the column solvers at any column count, and [`solve_spd`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd] whenever its
preconditioner is one this module built -- with Warp's stopping rule; only a block operator or a
caller's own ``LinearOperator`` goes to ``warp.optim.linear.cg``. Two costs of Warp's solver decide
it. Batching is expressed to Warp as ``batch_offsets``, which makes its dot-product reduction take
a per-column path whose cost grows with the vector length; and at ``check_every=0`` it records and
instantiates a fresh conditional graph on every call, which on the small and medium systems here
costs more than the iterations do. ``_BatchedCg`` reduces per column with a two-stage tree, runs
the Chronopoulos-Gear form of the iteration -- one mat-vec with all three of its dots, then one
update, two launches a round -- and records its loop once per state, where a solve through
[`solve_spd`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd] or [`solve_spd_columns`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd_columns]
keeps one state per operator, so a later solve against the same operator only replays it.

**Determinism.** Build each operator natively at its final dtype in a *single*
``warp.sparse.bsr_from_triplets`` and never recast or rebuild it. A rebuild re-sorts and
duplicate-accumulates an order the CSR already has; and if the rebuild's triplet buffers are ever
sized off ``BsrMatrix.nnz`` (a stale *capacity*, not the true entry count -- see ``nnz_sync()``) the
buffers' tail reaches ``bsr_from_triplets`` uninitialized. ``Q_uu`` is assembled as a CSR
*directly*, without any triplet build, so it carries an exact ``nnz``.

**Why Jacobi.** Every solve here preconditions with ``warp.optim.linear.preconditioner(A, "diag")``.
On a cotangent Laplacian a preconditioner costing ``k`` mat-vecs per iteration cuts the iteration
count by only about ``sqrt(k)``, so total work scales as ``sqrt(k)`` -- single-level preconditioning
loses on this operator class, and only a multilevel method escapes it. IC(0) would help if it were
available, but Warp has no sparse triangular solve, and no parallel substitute keeps its advantage:
a Jacobi-sweep approximation, an exact apply parallelized by graph coloring (whose uncoalesced
access and extra launches eat most of its iteration win), and natural-ordering level sets (whose
level count swings wildly with the input's vertex numbering) are all worse than Jacobi in practice.

**The exception is a polynomial**, because the ``sqrt(k)`` argument counts mat-vecs and a solve here
is bound by *launches*: an iteration is half a dozen launches and two reductions, while one step of
a Chebyshev polynomial in ``D⁻¹ A`` is a single fused mat-vec launch.
[`chebyshev_preconditioner`][triwarp.linalg.chebyshev_preconditioner] trades the iterations for
those steps and wins several-fold on long, ill-conditioned Laplacian solves -- the Poisson half of
the heat method, a graded patch -- while a short, well-conditioned one (a heat system, whose mass
term keeps it near diagonal) is faster under plain Jacobi. So it is an opt-in, taken where a caller
knows its solve is long. Chebyshev as the V-cycle's *smoother* is a separate question -- see
``_MULTIGRID_SWEEPS`` -- and so is a *squared* operator, where the polynomial is in its second-order
square root: [`squared_laplacian_preconditioner`][triwarp.linalg.squared_laplacian_preconditioner].

Two further obstacles are specific to this repository. Obtuse triangles give negative cotangent
weights, so ``-L`` is often not the M-matrix IC(0) existence requires; and both
[`heat_geodesic`][triwarp.heat.heat_geodesic] and
[`heat_signed_distance`][triwarp.heat.heat_signed_distance] solve a ``-L`` with a genuine constant
null space, where IC(0) hits a zero pivot on the last row of every connected component.

**The multilevel option** is [`multigrid_preconditioner`][triwarp.linalg.multigrid_preconditioner]:
smoothed aggregation, the one scheme that breaks the iteration count's growth with problem size
rather than paying it down by a constant factor. It is not the default, and the reason is the
*setup* rather than the cycle: building the hierarchy (one aggregation, one power iteration, a
``bsr_transposed`` and three ``bsr_mm`` per level) has a real fixed cost, so the V-cycle wins
exactly where the solve it replaces is long enough to amortize that setup and loses on a
well-conditioned or already-fast-converging system. See
[`CG_MULTIGRID_DOMINANCE`][triwarp.linalg.CG_MULTIGRID_DOMINANCE] for how the gate decides.

A GPU sparse direct solver (cuDSS through ``nvmath-python`` and CuPy) was considered and declined
for the same reason the multilevel preconditioner is gated: its cost is a host-side symbolic
factorization plan, flat regardless of conditioning, so it wins exactly on the systems the multigrid
gate already routes to a hierarchy and loses everywhere CG converges quickly. It would also add an
optional CUDA-only dependency, and a direct solver is singular on the empty rows CG tolerates
(unreferenced free vertices, which a caller would have to pin and restore). Reusing a factorization
plan across solves of one sparsity pattern is comparatively cheap, so a caller that resolves the
same operator repeatedly (as ``arap`` already does with its own preconditioner) is the shape that
would benefit.

Nothing cheap predicts in advance which side of the multigrid-versus-Jacobi line a system falls on,
which is why ``preconditioner="auto"`` uses a capped Jacobi probe rather than a heuristic predictor
of the iteration count; see [`CG_PROBE_ITERATIONS`][triwarp.linalg.CG_PROBE_ITERATIONS]. The
aggregation keeps a strength-of-connection threshold (``_MULTIGRID_THETA``) rather than every
off-diagonal, because on a graded (anisotropic) patch keeping every off-diagonal aggregates across
the weak direction and the hierarchy converges far more slowly.

**Routing through ``"auto"`` decides from the operator, not the caller**, and the axis that matters
is conditioning: only a system whose off-diagonal dominance clears
[`CG_MULTIGRID_DOMINANCE`][triwarp.linalg.CG_MULTIGRID_DOMINANCE] benefits from a hierarchy. A plain
Laplacian (``tutte``, ``min_quad_with_fixed`` on a raw cotangent matrix) and ``lscm``'s coupled u/v
system sit below that bar and a forced hierarchy regresses them, where a *squared* operator
(``harmonic`` at ``k >= 3``) sits comfortably above it. So
[`harmonic`][triwarp.parametrization.harmonic] passes ``"auto"`` at ``k >= 3``, and
[`min_quad_with_fixed`][triwarp.linalg.min_quad_with_fixed] defaults to ``"adaptive"``. At ``k = 2``
the operator is ``L M^-1 L``, which
[`squared_laplacian_preconditioner`][triwarp.linalg.squared_laplacian_preconditioner] inverts as the
square of a Laplacian, and ``harmonic`` takes that instead.

!!! warning "``harmonic`` at ``k=2`` on a strongly graded patch may not converge under Jacobi"
    A ``k=2`` biharmonic operator on a strongly graded patch can be outside what
    Jacobi-preconditioned conjugate gradient reaches in ``float64`` at all: the iteration can hit
    its cap and return a residual several orders of magnitude above the requested tolerance, with
    nothing but a ``UserWarning`` to say so, producing a visibly wrong UV map. A caller who needs
    that combination should pass a stronger preconditioner and check the warning.

The heat system ``M - tL`` that [`heat_geodesic`][triwarp.heat.heat_geodesic] solves needs no
multilevel help of its own: it converges in a small, size-independent number of iterations, because
``t = h**2`` makes it a small perturbation of the mass matrix.

    Parameters

    fixed_values
        ``(n_rhs, n_dofs)`` prescribed values; only the entries where ``fixed_mask`` is ``True`` are

    tol

    check_every
        Iterations between residual tests, forwarded to
        [`solve_spd_columns`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd_columns]. The default tests on device every
        iteration; see there for the tradeoff. This entry point's own return type does not depend
        on it — the solver's ``(iterations, residual, atol)`` triple is not surfaced here.
    preconditioner
        Forwarded to [`solve_spd_columns`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd_columns]. ``"adaptive"`` (the
        default) because the eliminated operator is usually a plain Laplacian, whose rows nearly sum
        to zero and which a V-cycle does not help, and whose solve is short when many degrees of
        freedom are pinned and long when few are -- the one case Jacobi wins and the other the

    Returns
    -------
    solution : twt.Array2dFloat
        ``(n_rhs, n_free)`` solved values for the unpinned degrees of freedom.
    free_map : wp.array[wp.int32]

    The elimination is ``igl::min_quad_with_fixed``'s, without its ``Aeq`` linear-equality block --
    no caller here needs one.

    When every degree of freedom is pinned (``n_free == 0``) the prescribed values are the whole

    Solve one symmetric positive-definite system by preconditioned conjugate gradient.

    The single-right-hand-side form of
    [`solve_spd_columns`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd_columns], and deliberately dtype-agnostic: it
    carries scalar ``float64`` systems as well as the ``wp.mat22d``-block operators the
    tangent-field solvers build, whose right-hand side is an array of ``wp.vec2d``. ``solution`` is
    the initial guess and is overwritten in place, so warm starting is free.

    This exists so the Jacobi preconditioner and the iteration cap are decided in one place rather
    than re-derived at every call site.

    !!! note "``check_every`` defaults to a positive cadence here, which means host scalars"
        Unlike [`solve_spd_columns`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd_columns], which defaults to
        [`CG_CHECK_EVERY`][triwarp.linalg.CG_CHECK_EVERY], this defaults to
        [`CG_CHECK_EVERY_FALLBACK`][triwarp.linalg.CG_CHECK_EVERY_FALLBACK], so the return values
        are host scalars and a non-convergence warning can be raised. On a system this module
        solves itself (see ``preconditioner``) the loop is tested on device either way wherever the
        device allows it, and a positive cadence costs one readback of the result after the solve;
        ``check_every=0`` skips that and returns device arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix
        Symmetric positive-(semi-)definite operator. Scalar or block dtype.
    rhs
        Right-hand side, with as many rows as ``matrix``.
    solution
        Initial guess, overwritten with the result. Same shape and dtype as ``rhs``.
    tol
        Relative residual tolerance.
    maxiter
        Iteration cap. When ``None``, uses
        [`CG_MAXITER_FACTOR`][triwarp.linalg.CG_MAXITER_FACTOR] times the number of rows.
    check_every
        Residual-test cadence; ``0`` tests on device every iteration and returns device arrays.
    preconditioner
        Optional preconditioner for ``matrix``; Jacobi when ``None``. For a scalar ``float64`` or
        ``wp.mat22d`` operator, ``None`` and the operators
        [`jacobi_preconditioner`][triwarp.linalg.jacobi_preconditioner] and
        [`chebyshev_preconditioner`][triwarp.linalg.chebyshev_preconditioner] build for ``matrix``
        are solved by this module's own conjugate gradient through a state kept for ``matrix``'s
        lifetime, so a later solve against the same operator replays its recorded loop instead of
        recording one; any other operator is applied as given through ``warp.optim.linear.cg``.
    name
        Caller name, used in the non-convergence warning.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[int, float, float]
        Whatever ``warp.optim.linear.cg`` returns: iteration count, residual and tolerance. Device
        1-element arrays instead of host scalars when ``check_every=0``.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``rhs`` and ``solution`` are not all on one device.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        When the solve exhausts ``maxiter`` without reaching ``tol``. The returned ``solution`` is
        then whatever the last iterate happened to be, not an answer -- silence here is how a
        diverging solve reaches a caller looking like a converged one. Only detectable when
        ``check_every > 0``; under ``check_every=0`` the counts stay on device and testing them
        would reintroduce the readback that setting exists to avoid.

    !!! warning "``check_every=0`` returns device arrays, not host scalars"
        Under the default ``check_every=0`` nothing is ever read back, so the three returned values
        are 1-element **device arrays** — and the second and third are the *squared* residual norm
        and *squared* absolute tolerance, matching ``warp.optim.linear.cg``. Code that formats or
        compares them must call ``.numpy()`` first, which reintroduces the host sync the setting
        exists to avoid. Pass a positive ``check_every`` to get host scalars back. ``solution`` is
        unaffected either way.

        On a device without conditional CUDA graphs there is nowhere to put the device-side test,
        so ``check_every=0`` is replaced by
        [`CG_CHECK_EVERY_FALLBACK`][triwarp.linalg.CG_CHECK_EVERY_FALLBACK] and host scalars come
        back instead. Warp's own behaviour in that case is to run every solve to ``maxiter`` —
        ``CG_MAXITER_FACTOR * n`` iterations of guaranteed waste — so substituting the cadence is
        the only usable reading of the request.


    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix
        ``(n, n)`` symmetric positive-definite operator, ``float64``.
    rhs
        ``(n_rhs, n)`` right-hand sides, one per row. Must be contiguous.
    solution
        ``(n_rhs, n)`` initial guess, overwritten with the result. Must be contiguous.
    tol
        Relative residual tolerance, as a ratio of the right-hand-side norm.
    maxiter
        Iteration cap. Defaults to ``CG_MAXITER_FACTOR * n``.
    check_every
        How many iterations run between residual tests. ``0`` (the default) tests every iteration
        on device; see Notes for the tradeoff and the warning above for what it does to the return
        type.
    preconditioner
        ``"diag"`` (the default) for the Jacobi preconditioner, ``"chebyshev"`` for the
        Jacobi-Chebyshev polynomial [`chebyshev_preconditioner`]
        [triwarp.linalg.chebyshev_preconditioner] applies -- the choice for a long solve of a
        symmetric Laplacian-like system, and a loss on a short one -- ``"adaptive"`` for Jacobi
        under a probe of
        [`CG_CHEBYSHEV_PROBE_ITERATIONS`][triwarp.linalg.CG_CHEBYSHEV_PROBE_ITERATIONS] rounds that
        escalates to that polynomial, warm-started, only if the probe has not converged -- the
        choice for a caller whose solves may be short or long -- ``"multigrid"`` for the
        smoothed-aggregation V-cycle [`multigrid_preconditioner`]
        [triwarp.linalg.multigrid_preconditioner] builds, or ``"auto"`` to let the operator decide.
        ``"auto"`` first tests the assembled system against
        [`CG_MULTIGRID_DOMINANCE`][triwarp.linalg.CG_MULTIGRID_DOMINANCE] and its size floor: a
        system that clears the gate builds the V-cycle outright, and one that does not runs Jacobi
        under [`CG_PROBE_ITERATIONS`][triwarp.linalg.CG_PROBE_ITERATIONS] and escalates only if
        that has not converged. The V-cycle costs a setup pass and pays for itself only where the
        solve dominates the call, so ``"auto"`` is the setting for a caller whose systems vary --
        it cannot regress a solve that was already short, though it can forgo a small win on a
        small ill-conditioned system that the size floor declines. See that function's Notes, and
        both constants. For normal equations whose square block is a scaled Laplacian, pass the
        operator
        [`squared_laplacian_preconditioner`][triwarp.linalg.squared_laplacian_preconditioner]
        builds instead of a name.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[int, float, float]
        ``(iterations, residual_norm, absolute_tolerance)`` on ``warp.optim.linear.cg``'s terms,
        with the residual taken over the worst column. Device arrays rather than host scalars under
        ``check_every=0``; see the warning above. Those arrays belong to the solver state kept for
        ``matrix`` and are overwritten by the next solve against it, so read them before then.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``preconditioner`` is not one of the five names above. It is rejected rather than
        treated as ``"diag"``, so a misspelling cannot turn into a silently slower solve.
    RuntimeError
        If ``rhs`` and ``solution`` are not all on one device.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        When the solve exhausts ``maxiter`` without reaching ``tol``, on the same terms as
        [`solve_spd`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd]. A batched solve converges on its *worst* column,
        so hitting the cap here means at least one column is unsolved. Only detectable when
        ``check_every > 0``.

    Notes
    -----
    ``check_every`` is a pure performance knob on every path but one -- it cannot change the
    converged answer, only how far past the tolerance the solver may overshoot before it notices.
    The exception is the exactly-two-column, ``"diag"``-preconditioned path: it shares one Krylov
    subspace across both columns, so a positive ``check_every`` can let a batch of iterations apply
    a real, coupled update to a column that already crossed its own tolerance. Its device-side
    default (``0``) scales with how much work a single ``cg`` call does, and the regimes disagree,
    so read the one that matches the caller:

    - **Cold single solves** -- one ``cg`` call from a zero initial guess, the shape ``harmonic`` /
      ``tutte`` / ``smooth_region`` take. The regime the default is set for, and a clear win there.
    - **Warm-started solves inside an iteration loop** -- ``arap``, whose right-hand side changes
      every
      iteration so each solve still runs tens of CG iterations from the previous answer. Neutral to
      mildly positive.
    - **Repeated near-converged solves over one
      [`spd_column_solver`][triwarp.linalg.spd_column_solver] state** -- the same right-hand side
      re-solved back to back, so every call after the first converges in one or two iterations. Here
      the device-side check's fixed per-call cost dominates a solve that short, so it is a real
      loss; pass a positive ``check_every`` to a state driven that way.
    - **Raising ``check_every`` well above the default is a loss in every regime**: the readback it
      saves is cheap, while the extra iterations it can cause are real work -- the smaller the
      solve, the worse the trade.

    The *preconditioner* is not a knob worth turning beyond these four: IC(0) comes out a wash or a
    loss against Jacobi, and ``"chebyshev"`` wins only where the solve is long. See "Why Jacobi" in
    the [`triwarp.linalg`][triwarp.linalg] module documentation. The *per-iteration* cost of
    batching was a separate lever and has been taken: with more than one column this runs triwarp's
    own conjugate gradient rather than ``warp.optim.linear``'s, because Warp's reduction degrades on
    precisely the batched input the worst-case stopping rule needs -- see "Whose conjugate gradient"
    there.

    Pre-allocated batched conjugate-gradient state, for repeated solves of one operator.

    Same solve as [`solve_spd_columns`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd_columns], but the temporary buffers
    and the batch layout are allocated once and the returned state is callable. Build it *outside* a
    per-iteration loop and call it inside: ``solve_spd_columns`` would otherwise reallocate its
    temporaries and rebuild the operator wrappers on every iteration.

    ``rhs`` and ``solution`` are captured at construction, so a loop that overwrites those same
    buffers in place can call the state with no arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix
        ``(n, n)`` symmetric positive-definite operator, ``float64``. Held by the returned state.
    rhs
        ``(n_rhs, n)`` right-hand sides; re-read from this buffer on every call.
    solution
        ``(n_rhs, n)`` initial guess and result; warm-started from its current contents each call.
    tol
        Relative residual tolerance.
    maxiter
        Iteration cap. Defaults to ``CG_MAXITER_FACTOR * n``.
    check_every
        Iterations between residual tests; see
        [`solve_spd_columns`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd_columns] for the tradeoff and for what the
        default ``0`` does to the values each call returns.
    preconditioner
        ``"diag"``, ``"chebyshev"``, ``"adaptive"`` or ``"multigrid"``, as in
        [`solve_spd_columns`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd_columns]. Built once here and reused by every
        call against this state, which is the shape the V-cycle's setup cost wants; ``"adaptive"``
        decides on every call, and builds its polynomial on the first call that escalates.
        ``"auto"`` is **not** accepted: it decides on the first solve -- from that system's
        operator, and from the probe when the operator does not settle it -- and a hoisted state
        exists to be driven many times.

    Returns
    -------
    internal batched state
        Callable solver state, this module's own ``_BatchedCg`` at every column count, kept
        internal because a caller never has to name it (see the
        [`triwarp.linalg`][triwarp.linalg] module's "Whose conjugate gradient").
        Substituted operands must match the construction-time shape, dtype, device and batch
        layout. Each call returns what
        [`solve_spd_columns`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd_columns] returns, including its
        ``check_every=0`` device arrays.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``preconditioner`` is ``"auto"``, for the reason above, or is not one of the four names
        this accepts.
    RuntimeError
        If ``rhs`` and ``solution`` are not all on one device.

    Examples
    --------
    ```python
    solver = spd_column_solver(q_uu, rhs, solution, tol=1e-10)

    """
    Run Jacobi conjugate gradient until every entry of the solution has settled relative to itself.

    A stopping rule for systems whose solution spans many orders of magnitude, where a residual
    tolerance says nothing about the small entries: the heat method's diffusions, whose far field
    sits hundreds of orders of magnitude below the source and is still zero, or noise, long after
    the residual has converged. The solve runs at a zero residual tolerance, one continuous
    iteration, and every ``check_rounds`` rounds compares the iterate with the one ``check_rounds``
    earlier: it stops once no entry has newly become non-zero and none moved by
    ``change_tolerance`` or more of its own value -- or ``settle_rounds`` rounds after the count of
    non-zero entries last changed, the bound for an entry that never settles because it cancels
    toward zero. Or at ``maxiter``.

    The iteration reads a ``float64`` operator's values in ``float32``, widened as they are read
    and accumulated in ``float64``: past a few tens of thousands of rows a round is bound by its
    bytes and the values are its largest stream. The system solved therefore differs from
    ``matrix`` by one rounding per stored entry, which on the heat method's operators is orders of
    magnitude below the method's own discretization error. The residual, the iterate and every
    reduction stay ``float64``.

    The check is tested on the device, inside the solve's recorded loop, so nothing is read back.
    As with [`solve_spd`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd], the solver state is kept for ``matrix``'s
    lifetime and a later solve against it replays the recorded loop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix
        Symmetric positive-definite operator, scalar ``float64`` or ``wp.mat22d``-block.
    rhs
        Right-hand side: ``(n,)`` ``float64`` or ``wp.vec2d`` matching ``matrix``, or
        ``(n_columns, n)`` ``float64`` columns against a scalar ``matrix``, solved together.
    solution
        Initial guess, overwritten with the result. Same shape and dtype as ``rhs``, contiguous.
    check_rounds
        Rounds between checks.
    change_tolerance
        Largest relative change per entry over ``check_rounds`` rounds that counts as settled.
    settle_rounds
        Rounds after the non-zero count last changed at which the solve stops regardless.
    maxiter
        Iteration cap. When ``None``, uses
        [`CG_MAXITER_FACTOR`][triwarp.linalg.CG_MAXITER_FACTOR] times the number of rows.
    preconditioner
        ``None``, or the operator [`jacobi_preconditioner`][triwarp.linalg.jacobi_preconditioner]
        built for ``matrix``: the solve is Jacobi-preconditioned either way.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.int32]
        One-element device array holding the rounds that took a step. It belongs to the solver
        state kept for ``matrix`` and is overwritten by the next solve against it.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``matrix`` and ``rhs`` are not one of the three pairings above, or ``preconditioner`` is
        not ``None`` or ``matrix``'s own Jacobi preconditioner.

    Run Jacobi under ``CG_PROBE_ITERATIONS``, then escalate if it has not converged.

    [`multigrid_preconditioner`][triwarp.linalg.multigrid_preconditioner] is for.

    The escalated solve does warm-start from the iterate the probe left in ``solution``, but **do

    drop-in for it, down to the ``(iterations, residual, tolerance)`` return contract. Callable
    like ``warp.optim.linear``'s solver state: the buffers are allocated once and every call
    re-reads ``rhs`` and warm-starts from whatever ``solution`` currently holds.


    Notes
    -----
    It is here because of what the batching costs inside Warp's solver rather than because of the
    arithmetic. ``replicated_operator`` attaches ``batch_offsets`` to get the per-column stopping
    rule, and that is precisely the input for which Warp's ``TiledDot`` selects a per-column
    reduction path whose cost grows with the vector length, where the reduction it uses for an
    unbatched vector stays flat -- and a CG iteration runs two of these dot products. Reducing per
    column with a real two-stage tree keeps the batching and drops that cost back down.

    A round is two launches, not six. It is the Chronopoulos-Gear form (1989), which recovers
    ``alpha`` from ``r.u`` and ``w.u`` with ``w = A u`` and carries ``s = A p`` by recurrence, so
    the mat-vec and all three of the round's dots are one launch and the update another -- where
    standard CG needs ``p.Ap`` before it can update ``r``, and ``r.z`` after, two reductions with a
    dependency between them. The Jacobi apply is an elementwise multiply of the ``r`` the update
    has just written, so it rides in that launch too. And the reductions' second stage needs no
    launch of its own: every block of the consumer folds its column's partials itself, through one
    fixed tree, so every block agrees (``CG_FOLD_MAX_BLOCKS`` bounds the column length where that
    pays). The conditional-graph test is then the largest single cost of a round; see
    ``CG_CHECK_EVERY``'s note for why it is not batched.

    **What was tried and is not here.** Solving the columns as separate unbatched ``cg`` calls also
    reaches the tree reduction, but it pays a second copy of every other kernel in the iteration and
    loses. Dropping ``batch_offsets`` to get the tree from a single call is not a tuning change at
    all -- ``alpha`` and ``beta`` would then be global rather than per column, which is CG on the
    block system and a different iteration. And **sharing the Krylov subspace across columns was
    tried and removed**: this class batches the *launches* but runs each column's iteration
    mathematically independently, so the counts are unchanged versus separate solves, where a
    classical block conjugate gradient (O'Leary 1980) over two columns reduces them on a uniform
    mesh at two more launches per iteration -- a wash there, and worse on a *graded* mesh, where the
    two search directions go nearly parallel and the count goes the other way.

    """
    Present one ``(n, n)`` operator as ``n_columns`` independent subproblems over a flat vector.

    The returned operator acts on length-``n_columns * n`` vectors laid out as ``n_columns``
    contiguous blocks — exactly the memory of a contiguous ``(n_columns, n)`` array — and carries
    the ``batch_offsets`` that make ``warp.optim.linear``'s solvers iterate all blocks together and
    converge on the worst-case residual. ``matrix`` is **not** replicated in memory: the ``matvec``
    applies the single operator to each block in turn.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix
        ``(n, n)`` operator: a ``warp.sparse.BsrMatrix``, a 1-D array (read as a diagonal), or an
        existing ``warp.optim.linear.LinearOperator`` such as a preconditioner.
    n_columns
        Number of independent right-hand-side columns.

    Returns
    -------
    ``warp.optim.linear.LinearOperator``
        Batched operator of shape ``(n_columns * n, n_columns * n)``.

    Notes
    -----
    A block-diagonal *matrix* would give the same batching at ``n_columns`` times the operator
    memory, and 2x2 blocks holding a scalar multiple of the identity would cost four times the
    storage and flops per scalar entry. Replicating only the ``matvec`` avoids both.

    ``batch_offsets`` is attached and ``max_batch_length`` deliberately is not, although this
    function knows the value exactly (every subproblem is ``n`` scalars): passing it to skip
    redundant reduction levels for a known maximum subproblem size made no measurable difference
    here, so it would be one more argument to explain for nothing. ``warp.optim.linear``'s
    ``restart`` option was also considered and is worse: resetting the search direction throws away
    the Krylov space CG has built, costing more iterations rather than buying better-conditioned
    ones.

    """

    Smoothed-aggregation multigrid preconditioner for a symmetric positive-semi-definite operator.

    A single-level preconditioner cannot break conjugate gradient's growth in the mesh size -- see
    "Why Jacobi" in the [`triwarp.linalg`][triwarp.linalg] module documentation for the alternatives
    that were tried and rejected -- because cutting the iteration count by ``sqrt(k)`` at ``k``
    mat-vecs per apply leaves the total work growing. A multigrid V-cycle attacks the low-frequency
    error the smoother cannot see, so the iteration count grows much more slowly with the problem
    size than it does under Jacobi.

    The returned operator acts on length-``n_columns * n`` vectors laid out as ``n_columns``
    contiguous blocks, exactly as [`replicated_operator`][triwarp.linalg.replicated_operator] does,
    so it drops into ``M=`` beside a Jacobi preconditioner without any other change.


    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix
        ``(n, n)`` symmetric positive-(semi-)definite operator, ``float64``. Zero diagonal entries
        are allowed: such a row is identically zero for a semi-definite operator, and the whole
        chain -- smoother, coarse solve and all -- leaves those unknowns at zero.
    n_columns
        Number of independent right-hand-side columns the operator will be applied to.
    seed
        Seeds the aggregation's randomized priorities and the power iteration's start vector, so a
        hierarchy is a deterministic function of the operator and this number.

    Returns
    -------
    ``warp.optim.linear.LinearOperator``
        The V-cycle, of shape ``(n_columns * n, n_columns * n)``. A **Jacobi** preconditioner
        instead when the operator does not coarsen -- see Notes.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the returned operator's ``matvec`` is called with ``alpha != 1`` or ``beta != 0``. A
        preconditioner apply is always ``z = M x``, and the general form would cost a pass that no
        caller needs.

    Notes
    -----
    Setup is not free and it is not amortized over anything: building the hierarchy costs one
    aggregation, one power iteration, two ``bsr_mm`` and one ``bsr_transposed`` per level. **Ask for
    this where the solve dominates the call**, and pass the same operator's preconditioner into a
    loop rather than rebuilding it -- [`solve_spd`][triwarp.linalg.solve_spd]'s ``preconditioner``
    parameter exists for exactly that.

    **The setup is host cost and it is per *level*, not per unknown, so it cannot be cut by making
    the operator smaller.** A level's cost is dominated by host-side overhead in
    ``warp.sparse.bsr_mm``, which makes device-to-host readbacks to size its output and so costs
    roughly the same regardless of the level's size. That is Warp's, not this package's, so the
    reachable lever is to build **fewer levels**, which is what ``_MULTIGRID_MAX_COARSE`` is set
    for.

    Coarsening stops at 128 rows, or earlier if a level fails to shrink; the coarsest operator is
    then inverted densely on the host, which is exact and is a single launch inside the cycle where
    an iterative coarse solve would be a data-dependent loop. When coarsening stalls while the level
    is still too large to factor, there is no usable hierarchy and this hands back
    ``warp.optim.linear.preconditioner(matrix, "diag")`` rather than a cycle whose coarse solve is a
    guess -- so a caller never has to branch on the operator's shape.

    !!! warning "That fallback is silent, and the strength threshold can trigger it"
        A stalled hierarchy is indistinguishable from a weak one at the call site: the solve simply
        runs at its Jacobi iteration count. ``_MULTIGRID_THETA`` decides how easily it happens --
        raising it makes more off-diagonals weak, and past some threshold an operator can stop
        coarsening entirely and come back at *exactly* the Jacobi count. So an aggregation change
        that "did nothing" should be checked against the level count before it is read as a change
        that did not help.

    Jacobi-Chebyshev polynomial preconditioner for a second-order symmetric definite operator.

    Applies ``z = p(D⁻¹ A) D⁻¹ r``, with ``D`` the diagonal of ``A`` and ``p`` the fixed
    degree-[`CHEBYSHEV_DEGREE`][triwarp.linalg.CHEBYSHEV_DEGREE] Chebyshev polynomial that
    approximates ``1 / x`` over an interval covering ``D⁻¹ A``'s spectrum -- the Chebyshev
    semi-iteration on the Jacobi-scaled system, run a fixed number of steps from zero. That is
    ``D^-1/2 p(D^-1/2 A D^-1/2) D^-1/2``, symmetric, and definite with the sign of ``A`` whenever
    ``p`` is positive on the spectrum, which the interval guarantees: its upper end is ``D⁻¹ A``'s
    Gershgorin bound and its lower end,
    [`CHEBYSHEV_INTERVAL`][triwarp.linalg.CHEBYSHEV_INTERVAL] over the unknown count, only sets how
    well the low end is resolved -- ``p`` stays positive below it.

    A conjugate-gradient solve on this hardware is bound by its launches rather than its flops, and
    each step of the polynomial is one fused mat-vec launch, where each iteration it removes is
    half a dozen launches and two reductions. So the iteration count falls several-fold and the
    solve with it, on well- and ill-conditioned Laplacian systems alike. It needs no setup beyond
    one copy of the matrix and one reduction for the bound: unlike
    [`multigrid_preconditioner`][triwarp.linalg.multigrid_preconditioner] there is no hierarchy.

    The setup -- one copy of the matrix and the bound's reduction, which reads one scalar back --
    runs at the operator's **first apply**, so building one that is never applied is free. That
    first apply therefore cannot sit inside a CUDA graph capture; ``warp.optim.linear.cg`` makes it
    before its own captured loop.

    !!! warning "The operator must be symmetric"
        ``p(D⁻¹ A) D⁻¹`` is symmetric only when ``A`` is, and conjugate gradient needs a symmetric
        preconditioner. Jacobi is symmetric whatever ``A`` is, which is why a mildly asymmetric
        system -- a row-normalized Laplacian's boundary rows -- still converges under it; do not
        hand such a system to this.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix
        ``(n, n)`` symmetric positive- or negative-(semi-)definite operator, ``float64``, whose
        diagonal carries its sign -- a cotangent Laplacian in either convention, a mass-plus-
        stiffness heat system. An empty row is allowed: the unknown no equation touches stays at
        zero.
    n_columns
        Number of independent right-hand-side columns the operator will be applied to.

    Returns

    ``warp.optim.linear.LinearOperator``

    """
    Preconditioner for normal equations ``(MᵀM) x = Mᵀ b`` whose square block is ``D⁻¹ L``.

    A least-squares umbrella system (``smoothing.smooth_region``'s) is a *squared*, fourth-order
    operator: its condition number is roughly the square of the Laplacian's, so Jacobi needs
    several times the iterations a Laplacian solve takes on the same unknowns, and smoothed
    aggregation -- built for second-order operators -- recovers only part of that. The standard
    remedy for a biharmonic-type system is to precondition it with the square of a second-order
    one. When the free rows of ``M`` form the square block ``M_ff = D⁻¹ L`` for a symmetric
    positive-definite ``L`` and a positive diagonal ``D``, ``M_ffᵀ M_ff`` is spectrally close to
    ``MᵀM`` -- the rows ``M`` adds beyond ``M_ff`` are one ring of the boundary -- so its inverse
    ``M_ff⁻¹ M_ff⁻ᵀ`` preconditions ``MᵀM`` well.

    It is applied as ``B Bᵀ``, with ``B`` a fixed Chebyshev polynomial in ``M_ff`` that
    approximates its inverse over ``[a, b]``. ``b`` is ``M_ff``'s Gershgorin bound -- ``2`` when
    every weight is non-negative, more when some are negative, as clamped cotangent weights can
    be -- which keeps the polynomial positive on every eigenvalue, so ``B`` is nonsingular and
    ``B Bᵀ`` symmetric positive-definite -- what conjugate gradient needs -- whatever ``a`` is.
    ``a`` only sets how well the low-frequency end is resolved; it is taken as
    [`SQUARED_LAPLACIAN_INTERVAL`][triwarp.linalg.SQUARED_LAPLACIAN_INTERVAL] over the unknown
    count, the rate at which a disc-like region's smallest eigenvalue falls. The setup is two
    copies of the matrix and one reduction for ``b``: a polynomial needs no hierarchy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    laplacian
        ``(n, n)`` symmetric positive-definite ``L``, ``float64``. An empty row is allowed and
        is left at zero, as it is in the system: an unknown no equation touches.
    weight_sums
        Length-``n`` diagonal of ``D``, positive. ``M_ff = D⁻¹ L``; give ``1`` for an empty row.

    Drop a matrix's explicitly-zero entries, by rebuilding it from its own CSR.

    ``bsr_mm`` returns a structural **superset** of the product, with the extra entries exactly

    ``c`` see fine row ``i``, so the Galerkin product inherits every aggregate reachable from it,
    which can blow up the pattern far more than the true product would. Pruning is part of the
    algorithm, not tidying, and it is what holds operator complexity down to a reasonable multiple.

    The extra entries are interspersed in column order rather than trailing reserved capacity, so
    they cannot be dropped by truncating a row -- the columns stay strictly increasing within every
