    Find the optimal transform mapping point cloud *a* onto *b*.

    Warp port of [`trimesh.registration.procrustes`][]. Accepts and returns
    GPU-resident arrays; no NumPy in the hot path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b:
        Corresponding point clouds, shape ``(n,)``, dtype ``wp.vec3``.
    weights:
        Per-point weights, shape ``(n,)``, dtype ``wp.float32``.
        Uniform weights are assumed when ``None``.
    reflection:
        Allow reflections in the rotation component.
    translation:
        Allow translation.
    scale:
        Allow uniform scaling.
    return_cost:
        Keyword-only. When ``True`` (the default) also return the transformed points and cost.

    Returns
    -------
    matrix:
        ``wp.array[wp.mat44]`` of shape ``(1,)`` encoding the transform.
    transformed:
        ``wp.array[wp.vec3]`` of shape ``(n,)`` — image of *a* under the transform.
        Only returned when ``return_cost=True``.
    cost:
        Weighted sum of squared distances between *transformed* and *b*.
        Only returned when ``return_cost=True``.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``a``, ``b`` and ``weights`` are not all on one device.
    ValueError
        If ``b`` (or a non-empty ``weights``) does not have the same length as ``a``, or a
        non-empty ``weights`` sums to zero.

    Notes
    -----
    Latency-bound at every size that matters: the fit is two kernel launches (four with
    ``return_cost``), one allocation for the packed moment accumulator and one readback, so the
    cost is nearly flat in ``n``. [`icp`][triwarp.registration.icp] runs the same fit inside a
    device-side loop, with no readback per iteration.

    **The returned matrix is column-vector, which is the transpose of pytorch3d's.**
    ``pytorch3d.ops.corresponding_points_alignment`` solves the row-vector form ``s X R + T = Y``,
    so its ``R`` is this matrix's linear block divided by the scale and *transposed*.

    Point-to-point iterative closest point registration.

    Aligns the source cloud *a* onto a target mesh or point cloud by repeatedly
    matching each source point to its nearest target counterpart and solving the
    resulting correspondence with [`procrustes`][triwarp.registration.procrustes].
    Following the ``pytorch3d`` formulation, every iteration re-aligns the
    *original* *a* to the current correspondences, so the returned transform is a
    single map from *a* to the target (no incremental-composition drift). Only a
    rough initial alignment is required for a good result.

    Warp port combining [`trimesh.registration.icp`][] and
    ``pytorch3d.ops.iterative_closest_point``. Correspondence search runs on the
    GPU via [`closest_point_on_mesh`][triwarp.proximity.closest_point_on_mesh]
    (mesh target) or [`query_nearest`][triwarp.neighbors.query_nearest]
    (point-cloud target); the alignment is the GPU tiled SVD of
    [`procrustes`][triwarp.registration.procrustes].

    Its ``R`` is the **transpose** of the linear block returned here, because it solves the
    row-vector form ``s X R + T = Y``; the *converged transform* is what is comparable, not the
    iteration count, since ``relative_rmse_thr`` is its own stopping rule.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a
        Source point cloud, shape ``(n,)``, dtype ``wp.vec3``.
    target_vertices
        Target vertex positions, shape ``(m,)``, dtype ``wp.vec3``. Used as the
        target point cloud when ``target_faces`` is ``None``.
    target_faces
        Flat ``(f * 3,)`` triangle index buffer. When given, the internally built ``wp.Mesh``
        aliases ``target_vertices`` and ``target_faces`` rather than copying them; do not mutate
        them for the duration of the call. When given (and non-empty),
        correspondences are the closest points on the triangle surface; otherwise
        the target is the point cloud ``target_vertices``.
    initial
        Initial transform seeding the first correspondence search, as a ``(1,)``
        ``wp.mat44`` array or a scalar ``wp.mat44``. Identity when ``None``.
    max_iterations
        Maximum number of ICP iterations.
    threshold
        Stop when the cost decreases by less than this between iterations.
    max_distance
        Reject correspondences farther than this (weight ``0``, excluded from the
        fit). No rejection when ``None``.
    reflection, translation, scale
        Forwarded to [`procrustes`][triwarp.registration.procrustes]. Defaults are
        rigid (`reflection=False, scale=False`); set ``scale=True`` for a
        similarity transform.

    Returns
    -------
    matrix
        ``(1,)`` ``wp.mat44`` transform mapping *a* onto the target.
    transformed
        ``(n,)`` ``wp.vec3`` image of *a* under *matrix*.
    cost
        Weighted mean squared correspondence distance at the final iteration.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``a``, ``target_vertices``, ``target_faces`` and ``initial`` are not all on one device.

    target_normals
        Per-vertex unit normals for a point-cloud target, shape ``(m,)``. Required
        (and only used) when ``target_faces`` is ``None``. Estimate them with
        [`estimate_normals`][triwarp.points.estimate_normals] if absent.
    initial
        Initial transform, as a ``(1,)`` ``wp.mat44`` array or scalar ``wp.mat44``.
        Identity when ``None``.
    max_iterations
        Maximum number of ICP iterations.
    threshold
        Stop after an iteration whose ``cost`` (see Returns) is less than ``threshold`` below the
        previous iteration's; a rise stops it too. The first iteration is never tested, and
        ``-inf`` runs all ``max_iterations``. For every kernel the tested quantity falls as the
        fit improves, including Tukey's, whose weights redescend.
    max_distance
        Reject correspondences farther than this. No rejection when ``None``.
    robust_kernel
        M-estimator applied to residuals: ``"none"``, ``"huber"``, or ``"tukey"``.
    robust_scale
        Tuning constant of the robust kernel (Huber ``k`` / Tukey ``c``). When
        ``None`` and a robust kernel is active, derived from the median absolute
        deviation of the first iteration's residuals.
    damping
        Relative Levenberg damping added to the normal-equations diagonal (scaled
        by its mean magnitude) for conditioning on planar/degenerate targets.

    Returns
    -------
    matrix
        ``(1,)`` ``wp.mat44`` rigid transform mapping *a* onto the target.
    transformed
        ``(n,)`` ``wp.vec3`` image of *a* under *matrix*.
    cost
        The robust objective summed over the final iteration's in-range correspondences, with
        ``r`` the point-to-plane residual: ``sum r^2`` for ``"none"``; ``sum w(r) r^2`` for
        ``"huber"``, i.e. ``r^2`` within ``k`` and ``k |r|`` beyond it; and for ``"tukey"`` twice
        the biweight loss, ``c^2 / 3 * (1 - (1 - (r / c)^2)^3)`` within ``c`` and ``c^2 / 3``
        beyond it, so a correspondence the kernel rejects still counts at the saturated value. It
        is the objective of the returned ``matrix`` itself, over correspondences found at that
        pose -- one more correspondence pass after the last step, so it is also defined with
        ``max_iterations=0``, where it scores the initial transform. ``math.inf`` when no
        correspondence at that pose carries weight.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``robust_kernel`` is not one of the three names, or if the target is a point cloud
        (``target_faces is None``) and ``target_normals`` is not provided, or does not have the
        same length as ``target_vertices``.
    RuntimeError
        If ``a``, ``target_vertices``, ``target_faces``, ``target_normals`` and ``initial`` are not
        all on one device.
