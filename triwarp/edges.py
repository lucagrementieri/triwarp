"""
Triangle edges: the directed corner edges, the deduplicated undirected set, and their lengths.

Three representations, and which one a caller wants depends on what an edge means to them:

- **directed corner edges** ([`faces_to_edges`][triwarp.edges.faces_to_edges]) — three per face, in
  corner order, so index ``3 * f + k`` is face ``f``'s edge ``k``. This is the halfedge indexing
  [`triwarp.halfedge`][triwarp.halfedge] builds on.
- **unique undirected edges** ([`edges_unique`][triwarp.edges.edges_unique]) — one per mesh edge,
  with [`edges_unique_inverse`][triwarp.edges.edges_unique_inverse] mapping each corner back to it.
- **per-face length tables** ([`face_edge_lengths`][triwarp.edges.face_edge_lengths]) — an
  ``(n_faces, 3)`` table in the *opposite-corner* column order the cotangent formulas want, which is
  the intrinsic description [`triwarp.laplacian`][triwarp.laplacian] consumes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` face index buffer.
    edges_sorted
        Optional precomputed ``(n_faces * 3, 2)`` sorted edges (each row min-first).
        When ``None``, built from ``faces``.
    n_vertices
        Total number of vertices (used as the hash base, and as the radix the unique rows are
        unpacked with). When ``None`` and ``validate`` is ``True`` it is inferred from the edge
        indices with a device-host sync -- the same reduction that runs the range check.
        When ``None`` and ``validate`` is ``False`` the keys pack against
        [`constants.INDEX_RADIX_PAIR`][triwarp.constants.INDEX_RADIX_PAIR] instead, which bounds
        every ``int32`` index with no reduction at all and leaves the row order unchanged.
    validate
        Whether to range-check the edge indices before packing them. The check is a
        ``triwarp.reduce.minmax`` whose host readback serialises the device pipeline, and it is a
        large share of this call because everything else here is launch overhead. Pass ``False``
        only where both bounds are structurally guaranteed -- a face buffer this package produced
        itself, or one an entry point has already validated. A ``False`` that is wrong does not
        raise: indices at or above ``n_vertices`` collide in the packing and silently group two
        different edges as one, and a negative index is read as a huge unsigned digit.

def mean_unique_edge_length(
    vertices: wp.array[wp.vec3], faces: wp.array[wp.int32], *, validate: bool = True
) -> float:
    """
    Mean length of the **unique** undirected edges.

    Each edge is counted once, however many faces share it. This is the definition
    ``igl::avg_edge_length`` and MeshLab's ``avg_edge_length`` both use, and the one
    ``igl::heat_geodesics`` picks its diffusion timestep from -- so it is what
    [`heat_geodesic`][triwarp.heat.heat_geodesic] and
    [`vector_heat_operators`][triwarp.heat.vector_heat_operators] use here.

    See [`mean_edge_length`][triwarp.edges.mean_edge_length] for the per-face average, how far the
    two diverge on an open mesh, and why libigl carries both.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` face index buffer.
    validate
        Forwarded to [`edges_unique`][triwarp.edges.edges_unique]. Pass ``False`` only where the
        face indices' range is structurally guaranteed; it removes a host readback.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Mean length over the unique undirected edges. ``0.0`` when ``n_faces == 0``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``validate`` is ``True`` and a face index is negative or reaches ``n_vertices``.
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices`` and ``faces`` are not all on one device.

    See Also
    --------
    [`mean_edge_length`][triwarp.edges.mean_edge_length]
        The same average taken over the per-face edges instead.
    [`edges_unique_length`][triwarp.edges.edges_unique_length]
        The per-edge lengths this averages.
