    Interior edges on the boundary of a face region.

    Returns the edges that have exactly two incident faces, exactly one of which is in
    ``face_mask`` — i.e. the interior seam separating the region from the rest of the mesh (mesh
    boundary edges, with a single incident face, are excluded).

    Parameters
    ----------
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer.
    face_mask
        Length-``n_faces`` ``wp.bool`` region mask.
    n_vertices
        Optional vertex count. Not read: the edge keys pack against
        [`constants.INDEX_RADIX_PAIR`][triwarp.constants.INDEX_RADIX_PAIR], which needs no vertex
        bound and orders them identically.
    oriented
        Return each row as the **directed** pair belonging to its region face, instead of the
        ascending pair. That puts the region on the left of the contour, which is the orientation
        [`faces_left_of_contour`][triwarp.selection.faces_left_of_contour] reads — the two are
        inverse and round-trip exactly. The default ascending form carries no orientation at all,
        so feeding it to that function seeds *both* sides and returns the whole mesh.

    Returns
    -------

    """
    Flood-fill the faces on the left of a directed contour of mesh edges.

    The dual of [`region_boundary_edges`][triwarp.selection.region_boundary_edges]: that one turns a
    face region into the seam around it, this one turns a seam back into a region. Which of the two
    sides comes back is decided **only** by the contour's direction: the seeds are the faces that
    own the halfedges ``a -> b``, and a face's corners run counter-clockwise, so reversing the rows
    returns the complement. Nothing else about the contour matters, and a closed contour on a closed
    mesh therefore partitions it exactly.

    The fill is a connected-component labelling of the face-adjacency graph with the contour's dual
    edges removed, so a contour that does *not* separate the mesh returns everything reachable --
    which is the whole surface. That is the honest answer rather than a failure, but it means the
    result is worth checking against the input's face count when the contour is meant to close.

    Parameters
    ----------
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer.
    contour_edges
        ``(k, 2)`` ``wp.int32`` **directed** vertex pairs, each an edge of the mesh. Consecutive
        rows need not be connected: the fill only cares about which edges are blocked and which
        halfedges seed it, so several disjoint contours can be passed at once. A row that is not a
        mesh edge blocks nothing and seeds nothing.
    n_vertices
        Optional total vertex count, forwarded to
        [`halfedge_twins`][triwarp.halfedge.halfedge_twins] as its key radix when ``twins`` is
        built here. Never inferred: every key this function packs itself uses
        [`constants.INDEX_RADIX_PAIR`][triwarp.constants.INDEX_RADIX_PAIR], which needs no bound.
    twins
        Optional precomputed [`halfedge_twins`][triwarp.halfedge.halfedge_twins]. Building it is the
        single largest cost here, so pass it when several contours are filled on one mesh.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.bool]
        Length-``n_faces`` mask, ``True`` for the faces on the left of the contour, on
        ``faces.device``. All-``False`` only when no contour row is a mesh edge whose left face
        exists.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If ``contour_edges`` is not a rank-2 ``wp.int32`` array.
    ValueError
        If ``contour_edges`` does not have two columns, or if ``twins`` is given and is not a
        twin table for ``faces``
        ([`require_matching_twins`][triwarp.halfedge.require_matching_twins] states what that
        means, and checking it costs one launch and one readback).
    RuntimeError

    Extract a face subset by index and reindex vertices from zero.

    Parameters
    ----------

    unique_indices
        Whether ``face_indices`` is known to hold no duplicates. Not read: a duplicated face
        reaches the vertices it already reached and keeps its own row, so the extraction is the
        same either way.

    Extract many face subsets at once: CSR groups in, CSR submeshes out.

    The batched form of
    [`submesh_from_face_indices`][triwarp.selection.submesh_from_face_indices]. Every launch count
    is ``O(1)`` in the number of groups, so extracting ten thousand components costs the same
    number of kernel launches and host synchronisations as extracting one — which is the whole
    point, since the per-group loop it replaces pays a sort, a scan and a readback *each*.

    How it stays batched: each corner of each selected face is packed into the single ``int64`` key
    ``group * n_vertices + vertex``, and one global
    [`unique_1d`][triwarp.grouping.unique_1d] deduplicates all groups together. Because the key is
    ``group * radix + vertex``, ascending key order is exactly ``(group, vertex)`` lexicographic
    order, so the unique slots come out already partitioned by group **and** ascending by original
    vertex index within each group — bit-identical to running ``unique_1d`` per group.

    A vertex shared by two groups is duplicated into both, matching
    [`trimesh.util.submesh`][] and the per-group loop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions on the target device.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` flat triangle index buffer.
    group_face_indices
        Concatenated face indices of every group, as ``wp.int32``. Indices must be unique within a
        group (duplicates would produce duplicate output faces).
    group_offsets
        Length-``k`` ``wp.int32`` start of each group in ``group_face_indices``, ascending, with
        ``group_offsets[0] == 0`` — the repo's no-terminator CSR convention (as in
        [`pack_1d_arrays`][triwarp.array.pack_1d_arrays] and
        [`successor_cycles`][triwarp.graph.successor_cycles]). Groups must be non-empty.

    mask does *not* select, and it answers the question that makes the result usable -- **which rims

    kept_vertices : wp.array[wp.vec3]
        Compact positions of the surviving submesh.

        Flat triangle index buffer into ``kept_vertices``.
    new_loops : list[wp.array[wp.int32]]
        The boundary loops the deletion opened, as vertex-index cycles **into** ``kept_vertices`` --
        the same form [`triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops] returns.
        A loop the input already had is excluded, so an open input's original rims do not appear.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``face_mask`` does not have one entry per face.
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices``, ``faces`` and ``face_mask`` are not all on one device.

    Examples
    --------
    ```python
    doomed = tw.validation.face_self_intersecting_mask(v, f)
    kept_v, kept_f, rims = tw.selection.delete_region_keep_boundary(v, f, doomed)
    ```

    Notes
    -----
    A loop counts as pre-existing when **every** one of its edges was already a boundary edge of the
    input. That is the right test rather than "any": deleting a face that touches an existing rim
    extends that rim rather than opening a new one, and the extended loop has to be reported --
    otherwise a caller filling only the new loops would leave the extension open.

    The test is answered from the deletion rather than from the input's boundary: a loop edge the
    survivor holds in exactly one face was an input boundary edge exactly when no deleted face
    contains it, so the classification sorts only the deleted faces' edges, never the mesh's. That
    holds for every loop [`triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops] can
    return, since each of its consecutive pairs is a boundary edge on any input. On a mesh that is
    not edge-manifold a rim can be missing from that trace altogether, and then it is not reported
    either. The call's cost is dominated by the loop trace and the submesh extraction, so anything
    spent optimizing this function further belongs in
    [`triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops] rather than here.

    """
    Grow a vertex selection by ``hops`` one-ring layers.

    Each round adds every vertex sharing a mesh edge with a currently-selected vertex, so after
    ``hops`` rounds the mask covers all vertices within graph distance ``hops`` of the input
    selection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer.
    mask
        Length-``n_vertices`` ``wp.bool`` selection to dilate.
    hops
        Number of one-ring dilation rounds (``0`` returns a copy).

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.bool]
        Dilated mask on ``mask.device``.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``faces`` and ``mask`` are not on one device.

    --------
    [`shrink_vertex_mask`][triwarp.selection.shrink_vertex_mask]

    Notes
    -----
    Dilation is vertex-based: a vertex enters the mask when any 1-ring neighbour is in it. On a
    triangle mesh two vertices are one-ring neighbours exactly when they share a face, so a round
    marks the corners of every face with a selected corner and no edge table is built. Vertices no
    face references are neither reached nor removed.
