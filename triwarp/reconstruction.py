"""
Building a triangle mesh whose triangulation is the method's own, not any input's.

- **From an oriented point cloud.**
  [`screened_poisson`][triwarp.reconstruction.screened_poisson] fits an implicit indicator function
  and contours it, so it closes gaps and returns a watertight surface that need not pass through
  any input point; [`ball_pivoting`][triwarp.reconstruction.ball_pivoting] instead *interpolates*
  the points, rolling a ball over them, and leaves a hole wherever the ball falls through.
  [`triangulate_point_cloud`][triwarp.reconstruction.triangulate_point_cloud] picks between them.
- **From a mesh.** [`resample_uniform`][triwarp.reconstruction.resample_uniform] samples an
  existing mesh's signed distance field on a uniform grid and re-extracts it, which is the way to
  get a clean, uniformly-sampled surface out of a self-intersecting or badly-triangulated one. It
  is shelved with the reconstructors rather than with the mesh edits because it shares their
  defining property: the output's triangulation comes from the grid, not from the input, so no
  vertex, edge or face survives the call.
- **In the plane.** [`delaunay_triangulation`][triwarp.reconstruction.delaunay_triangulation]
  triangulates a 2D point set.

Extracting a level set of a field you already hold is
[`levelset.marching_cubes`][triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes], not a reconstruction: it lives with
its consumers in [`triwarp.levelset`][triwarp.levelset], and ``screened_poisson`` and
``resample_uniform`` both end in it.

    """
    Delaunay triangulation of a 2D point set.

    Ports ``igl::delaunay_triangulation``: a sequential lexicographic incremental triangulation
    seeds the mesh, then interior edges are flipped until every one satisfies the empty-circumcircle
    (Delaunay) criterion. The flip loop reuses the parallel edge-flip machinery of
    [`flip_to_delaunay`][triwarp.remesh.flip_to_delaunay] with a float64 in-circle predicate; ties
    (cocircular points) are left unflipped, which guarantees termination.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points
        ``(n,)`` 2D point positions on the target device.
    max_iter
        Maximum number of parallel flip passes.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError

    The seed triangulation is an inherently sequential hull sweep, so it runs single-threaded on the

    faster on the CPU than as a single CUDA thread. A float64 in-circle determinant is used rather
    than exact predicates, so near-cocircular inputs may resolve either ambiguous diagonal.

    Reconstruct a triangle mesh from an (optionally oriented) point cloud.

    Local-triangulation reconstruction, on the GPU. Each point independently builds a local
    triangle fan over its nearest neighbours in the tangent plane, greedily
    optimised toward a Delaunay-like fan (``build_local_triangulations``); triangles that recur in
    two or three of these local triangulations are kept and assembled into a triangle-soup mesh
    (vertices are the input points). Non-manifold and degenerate faces are dropped and small
    boundary holes are filled.

    Orientation relies on **trusted normals** rather than on a sequential propagation pass, which
    is what keeps the assembly parallel: supply ``normals`` for arbitrary geometry, or leave them
    ``None`` to estimate them by PCA oriented outward from the cloud centroid (valid for
    star-shaped clouds only — see [`estimate_normals`][triwarp.points.estimate_normals]).

    Parameters
    ----------
    points
        ``(n,)`` point positions on the target device.
    normals
        Optional ``(n,)`` oriented unit normals. When ``None``, normals are estimated.
    num_neighbours
        Number of nearest neighbours used per point when ``radius <= 0``. Defaults to
        ``max_neighbours`` when neither ``num_neighbours`` nor ``radius`` is set.
    radius
        When positive, only neighbours within this distance are used (still capped at
        ``max_neighbours`` nearest). Mutually exclusive with ``num_neighbours``.
    crit_angle
        Maximum dihedral angle (radians) tolerated in a fan triangle before an edge is flipped.
    boundary_angle
        A point is a fan boundary when its neighbour ring has an angular gap wider than this.
    max_neighbours
        Per-point neighbour cap. Must not exceed
        ``kernels.reconstruction.MAX_NEIGHBOURS`` (the compile-time scratch size).
    crit_hole_length
        Boundary loops with perimeter at most this value are filled. When negative, defaults to
        ``0.1 *`` the point-cloud bounding-box diagonal.

    Returns
    -------
    vertices : wp.array[wp.vec3]
        The referenced input points, compacted from index zero (unreferenced points dropped),
        on ``points.device``.
    faces : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Flat ``3 * n_faces`` triangle index buffer into ``vertices``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If both ``num_neighbours`` and ``radius`` are positive, or ``max_neighbours`` exceeds the
        compile-time cap.
    RuntimeError
        If ``points`` and ``normals`` are not all on one device.

    Notes
    -----
    The per-point fan is bounded by ``max_neighbours`` and the search radius is never grown
    automatically, so very sparse or highly non-uniform clouds may leave extra boundary holes.

    Screened-Poisson surface reconstruction from an oriented point cloud (Kazhdan PoissonRecon).

    GPU-native reimplementation of the screened-Poisson filter (PyMeshLab's
    ``generate_surface_reconstruction_screened_poisson``, ``open3d``'s
    ``create_from_point_cloud_poisson``).
    A dense node-centered grid over a padded bounding cube is used instead of PoissonRecon's octree:
    the oriented normals are trilinearly splatted into a smoothed vector field ``V`` (with a density
    weight ``W``), the indicator function ``x`` is recovered by solving the screened-Poisson system
    ``(L_N + point_weight * W) x = -div V`` matrix-free with a Jacobi-preconditioned conjugate
    gradient, and the iso-surface is extracted with ``warp.MarchingCubes`` at the iso-value given by
    the average of ``x`` over the input points. A **cascadic** coarse-to-fine schedule solves the
    system from ``full_depth`` up to ``depth``, prolonging each level's solution as the next level's
    initial guess (mirroring PoissonRecon's multigrid hierarchy).

    ``normals`` are **required** and must be globally consistently oriented (all pointing outward or
    all inward): the reconstruction encodes the surface orientation in the sign of the vector field,
    and [`estimate_normals`][triwarp.points.estimate_normals] performs no global orientation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points
        ``(n,)`` point positions on the target device (``n >= 3``).
    normals
        ``(n,)`` oriented unit normals (their magnitude is used as a confidence weight when
        ``confidence`` is set).
    depth
        Finest grid depth: the finest grid has ``2**depth + 1`` nodes per axis. Memory grows as the
        cube of this; ``depth=8`` (a ``257**3`` grid) is a safe default and ``depth`` is capped at
        ``10``. This is the single biggest lever on both cost and quality — see Notes before
        lowering it.
    full_depth
        Coarsest depth of the cascade (``3 <= full_depth <= depth``). The system is solved at every
        depth from ``full_depth`` to ``depth``.
    scale
        Ratio between the reconstruction cube's side and the point cloud's largest bounding-box
        extent (``>= 1``, so the cube always contains the cloud); ``1.1`` pads the cloud by 10 %.
    point_weight
        Screening weight ``alpha`` tying the iso-surface to the input samples. ``0`` recovers the
        unscreened Poisson reconstruction (a tiny epsilon is still added to keep the operator SPD).
    solver_iterations
        Maximum conjugate-gradient iterations per cascade level. The default leaves room: the dense
        grid's multigrid-preconditioned solve reaches the default tolerance in a dozen or so at any
        depth, and the adaptive backend's Jacobi-preconditioned one in under a hundred.
    solver_tolerance
        Relative residual tolerance for the conjugate-gradient solve. A level that stops at
        ``solver_iterations`` above it warns. The system is solved in ``float32``, whose rounding
        bounds the relative residual either backend can actually reach at a few ``1e-6`` -- a
        tolerance below that is never met and only spends the whole iteration budget.
    confidence
        When ``True``, weight each sample's splat by ``|normals[i]|`` (treating the normal magnitude
        as a per-sample confidence), matching PoissonRecon's ``confidence`` flag.
    method
        Solver backend. ``"dense"`` (default) uses the dense node-centered grid described above.
        ``"adaptive"`` uses a ``warp.fem`` adaptive Nanogrid refined only near the samples with a
        variational (finite-element) assembly: fewer degrees of freedom for the same finest
        resolution, so it reaches higher ``depth`` on the same memory budget. The two backends agree
        up to discretization. A point-source weak form rings when the cells are much finer than the
        sampling, so the adaptive backend caps the finest near-surface cell at roughly the mean
        sample spacing (PoissonRecon-style); a ``depth`` above what the sampling supports then only
        refines the extraction lattice. It lazily imports ``warp.fem`` (a one-time codegen cost of
        tens of seconds on first use).

    Returns
    -------
    vertices : wp.array[wp.vec3]
        Iso-surface vertices on ``points.device``.
    faces : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Flat ``3 * n_faces`` triangle index buffer, free of zero-area triangles
        ([`remove_degenerate_faces`][triwarp.repair.remove_degenerate_faces]) and oriented outward
        ([`make_normals_outward`][triwarp.repair.make_normals_outward]).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``points`` has fewer than 3 points, or the depth/scale parameters are out of range.
    RuntimeError
        If ``points`` and ``normals`` are not all on one device.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        When a level's conjugate-gradient solve stops at ``solver_iterations`` with its residual
        still above ``solver_tolerance``: the surface is then extracted from an unconverged field.

    [`ball_pivoting`][triwarp.reconstruction.ball_pivoting]
    [`estimate_normals`][triwarp.points.estimate_normals]

    Notes
    -----
    The whole system is solved in index space (grid spacing ``1``); the world scale is reapplied by
    marching cubes via the cube bounds, so the extracted level set is invariant to that scale. The
    per-node density normalization ``V /= max(W, eps)`` is cruder than PoissonRecon's kernel-density
    estimate and can bulge on strongly anisotropic clouds. The screening weight ``point_weight`` is
    not area-normalized as in PoissonRecon, so its numeric scale differs; ``4`` is a reasonable
    default for unit-scale clouds.

    **Choosing ``depth``.** The useful depth follows the cloud's *sampling density*, not its size,
    and past that point extra depth costs time without buying fidelity -- once the grid outruns the
    samples, accuracy can get worse rather than better. The default of ``8`` matches PoissonRecon's
    own; for a known cloud density it is worth lowering. The ``adaptive`` backend is much flatter in
    depth (it already caps near-surface refinement at the sample spacing) and is the better choice
    when the depth wanted for the extraction lattice exceeds what the sampling supports.

    **``point_weight=0`` is ill-conditioned, and its output is not reproducible.** Screening is what
    conditions the operator; at ``0`` only the ``1e-4`` floor above keeps it SPD, so the conjugate
    gradient stops on a solution whose level set is genuinely uncertain, and the face count (and
    how many faces come out zero-area before the cleanup described under ``Returns``) varies
    between runs on the same input; the surface is also not watertight. The default
    ``point_weight=4`` is stable across runs and watertight. So ``0`` is for comparing *against* a
    screened reconstruction, not for producing one -- and do not pin a count taken from it.

    grows with it -- to the point that a 100-iteration cap left the finer levels two orders of
    magnitude short of their tolerance.

    Every level's cycle starts from a zero guess, where the first sweep ``omega D^-1 b`` reads no
    neighbour, so it is not a launch of its own: the launch that writes a level's right-hand side
    writes that sweep into the level's ``start`` too (``poisson_mg_restrict`` on the coarse levels;
    on the finest, the caller -- the conjugate gradient's initial-residual and update kernels --
    into ``start`` before each ``apply``). A cycle is then four launches a level.

    Rebuild a mesh by sampling its signed distance field on a uniform grid and re-extracting it.

    MeshLab's ``generate_resampled_uniform_mesh``. Three uses, all the same call:

    - **Regularize.** The output triangulation comes from the grid, not from the input, so every
      pathology of the input topology — self-intersections, non-manifold edges, duplicated or
      inverted faces, a soup — is simply not carried over. This is the bluntest repair there is and
      the one that always works.
    - **Offset.** A positive ``offset`` extracts the level set *outside* the surface (a dilation)
      and a negative one inside (an erosion): how shells, clearances and tool paths are built.
    - **Shrink-wrap.** A coarse ``voxel_size`` with ``offset=0`` gives a watertight envelope of a
      complicated input.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer.
    voxel_size
        Grid spacing. Defaults to ``1 %`` of the bounding-box diagonal, which is a ~100-cell grid
        across the mesh. **Cost is cubic in the reciprocal**, so halving it is eight times the field
        evaluation; and no feature thinner than a voxel survives.
    offset
        Level set to extract, in world units. ``0`` (the default) reproduces the surface.
    sign_mode
        How the sign of the distance field is decided, forwarded to
        [`signed_distance_on_mesh`][triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_on_mesh]. The default here is
        ``"winding"`` rather than that function's ``"parity"``: resampling is usually applied to a
        mesh that is *broken*, and ray parity has no principled answer through a hole, while the
        generalized winding number degrades gracefully.

    Returns
    -------
    vertices : wp.array[wp.vec3]
        Resampled vertex positions on ``vertices.device``.
    faces : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Flat ``3 * n_faces`` triangle index buffer.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``voxel_size`` is not positive.
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices`` and ``faces`` are not all on one device.

    See Also

    Notes
    -----
    The grid is padded by three voxels beyond the bounding box *plus* ``offset``, so a dilated level
    set is never clipped by the lattice boundary and the extracted surface is always closed. That
    padding is why the memory cost is a little above ``(extent / voxel_size) ** 3``.

    Ball-pivoting surface reconstruction from an oriented point cloud (interpolating).

    GPU-native, wave-parallel port of the ball-pivoting algorithm (PyMeshLab's
    ``generate_surface_reconstruction_ball_pivoting``, ``open3d``'s
    ``create_from_point_cloud_ball_pivoting``, vcglib BPA). A ball of the given ``radius`` is rolled
    over the oriented points; wherever it rests on three points without containing another point it
    forms a triangle, and it then pivots around each boundary edge of the growing front to add the
    next triangle. The output mesh **interpolates** the input points (its vertices are a subset of
    ``points``), unlike the implicit
    [`screened_poisson`][triwarp.reconstruction.screened_poisson].

    The advancing front is a **persistent** device-side structure — an edge hash table plus a
    compacted list of its boundary edges, mutated in place as triangles commit. Each wave pivots
    every live front edge independently through a hash-grid ball query and commits a conflict-free
    independent set via a two-phase vertex claim. Manifoldness is protected by an interior-edge
    guard (an edge already shared by two triangles never gains a third). The result is passed
    through the standard cleanup tail (deduplicate, drop degenerate / non-manifold faces, orient
    outward, optionally fill small holes).


    Parameters
    ----------
    points
        ``(n,)`` point positions on the target device (``n >= 3``).
    normals
        Optional ``(n,)`` oriented unit normals. When ``None``, they are estimated by PCA oriented
        outward from the centroid ([`estimate_normals`][triwarp.points.estimate_normals]; valid for
        star-shaped clouds only).
    radius
        Ball radius. When ``<= 0``, it is auto-guessed as ``1.5 x`` the mean nearest-neighbour
        spacing — a device reduction, so the guess is not bit-reproducible between calls and neither
        is the triangulation built from it (see ``Notes``).
    clustering
        Candidate points closer than ``clustering * radius`` to an edge endpoint are rejected
        (vcglib clustering, as a fraction of ``radius``).
    crease_angle
        Maximum dihedral angle (radians) between a new triangle and the one it pivots from; larger
        folds are rejected. Use ``>= pi`` to disable the crease guard.
    max_waves
        Maximum number of parallel waves, where each wave either pivots the current front or seeds
        orphan triangles. ``0`` picks a generous safety cap from the point count.
    crit_hole_length
        Boundary loops with perimeter at most this value are filled at the end. ``0`` disables hole
        filling; a negative value defaults to ``0.1 x`` the bounding-box diagonal.

    Returns
    -------
    vertices : wp.array[wp.vec3]
        The referenced input points, compacted from index zero, on ``points.device``.
    faces : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Flat ``3 * n_faces`` triangle index buffer, oriented outward.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If fewer than 3 points are given.
    RuntimeError
        If ``points`` and ``normals`` are not all on one device.

    Notes
    -----
    A single radius is used (the classic multi-radius schedule is a documented follow-up), and the
    triangle budget grows on demand rather than raising.

    The triangulation is **reproducible at an explicit ``radius``**: repeated runs on one device and
    build return the same set of triangles, because a wave resolves competing proposals by a key
    packed from their own vertices and the wave counter rather than by the order they reached an
    atomic counter -- device state the loop advances deterministically, so the ordering varies
    between waves (which keeps a front edge from being starved by a globally fixed key) without
    varying between runs. Three caveats on how far that reaches:

    * the default ``radius <= 0`` is **not** covered. The auto-guess averages the nearest-neighbour
      spacings with a device reduction whose summation order is not fixed, so two calls on one cloud
      can guess radii a few ULP apart -- enough to tip a borderline pivot and change the triangle
      set. Pass ``radius`` explicitly wherever the result has to be reproducible;
    * the face buffer's *row order* is not pinned -- ``commit_triangles`` appends with a
      ``wp.atomic_add`` -- so compare reconstructions as a set of triangles, not buffer-to-buffer;
    * neither is the *winding* of a component the cleanup tail cannot orient by volume, since
      [`make_winding_consistent`][triwarp.repair.make_winding_consistent] seeds each connected
      component from an arbitrary face. Compare with the row entries sorted, or orient both sides
      first.

    Results are not comparable across devices, where floating-point contraction differs.

    The result is **interpolating and edge-manifold**, and on a densely, uniformly sampled closed
    surface it is watertight in practice: a subdivided icosphere reconstructs to exactly ``2 v - 4``
    faces with no boundary edge at all. Watertightness is not *guaranteed* -- the wave-parallel
    front has no per-vertex fan structure to align colliding sheets with, so pathological sampling
    can still leave a seam. Regions sampled too sparsely for the ball to rest are left as holes by
    construction (widen ``radius`` or set ``crit_hole_length``); for an implicit surface that is
    watertight by construction use [`screened_poisson`][triwarp.reconstruction.screened_poisson].

    triangle budget, to compact a sparse front, or to stop.

    The invariant every batch boundary restores is that **``front_in`` holds the live front**: a
    wave reads ``front_in`` and writes ``front_out``, so one host swap per wave hands the result to
    the next one. The batch is queued blind, though, and the device may stop partway through it —
    every wave kernel opens with ``if counters[CNT_CONTINUE] == 0: return`` — so the trailing waves
    of a batch write nothing while the loop below swaps for them regardless. An odd number of those
    leaves the pair exchanged, and ``compact()`` then reads the buffer the *previous* wave wrote
    (in the first batch, one that ``wp.empty`` never wrote at all). ``CNT_WAVE`` counts only the
    waves that ran, and the batch's counter readback is already paid for, so the correction is a
    parity test on a number the host is holding.
