"""
Unstructured point-cloud geometry: fitting, second moments and normal estimation.

No connectivity here -- everything takes a bare ``(n,)`` array of positions. Four groups:

- **Whole-cloud fits.** [`centroid`][triwarp.points.centroid],
  [`covariance`][triwarp.points.covariance] and
  [`centered_covariance`][triwarp.points.centered_covariance] give the second moments;
  [`fit_line`][triwarp.points.fit_line] and [`fit_plane`][triwarp.points.fit_plane] read the
  dominant and weakest eigenvector off them. [`gram_matrix`][triwarp.points.gram_matrix] is the
  uncentered form, for callers that want to center differently.
- **Per-point.** [`estimate_normals`][triwarp.points.estimate_normals] fits a plane to each point's
  k-nearest neighbourhood, which is how an unoriented cloud acquires normals before reconstruction.
  [`outlier_probability`][triwarp.points.outlier_probability] and
  [`statistical_outlier_mask`][triwarp.points.statistical_outlier_mask] score the same neighbourhood
  for isolation, which is how a scanned cloud loses its stragglers *before* the normals are fitted.
  [`plane_basis`][triwarp.points.plane_basis] and [`radial_sort`][triwarp.points.radial_sort] then
  let a caller work in the tangent plane it defines.
- **Cleanup and subsampling.** Four masks and one selector, all returning indices or
  ``wp.array[wp.bool]`` rather than a copied cloud, so a caller pays for the gather only if it wants
  one: [`point_finite_mask`][triwarp.points.point_finite_mask] and
  [`point_duplicate_mask`][triwarp.points.point_duplicate_mask] are the two exact predicates,
  [`radius_outlier_mask`][triwarp.points.radius_outlier_mask] and
  [`statistical_outlier_mask`][triwarp.points.statistical_outlier_mask] the two density ones (an
  absolute floor and a cloud-relative threshold), and
  [`farthest_point_sample`][triwarp.points.farthest_point_sample] picks an exact count spread over
  the cloud's support. Run the exact predicates first: they are cheap and they remove the inputs the
  others are ill-defined on.
- **Approximate hull vertices.** Which points are convex-hull vertices, without building a hull.
  Both entry points are exact-hull-free and run in a fixed number of parallel launches, and both are
  one-sided -- but in *opposite* directions:

    - [`convex_subset_mask`][triwarp.points.convex_subset_mask] (and its point-returning form
      [`convex_subset`][triwarp.points.convex_subset]) accumulates *positive* certificates: a
      direction a point is extremal along proves it is on the hull. Cheap and precise, but a hull
      vertex with no sampled certificate is dropped, so the result can be **smaller** than the
      hull-vertex set.
    - [`convex_superset_mask`][triwarp.points.convex_superset_mask] accumulates *negative*
      certificates: a tetrahedron of hull points strictly containing a point proves that point is
      interior. It keeps everything it cannot rule out, so the result is **never smaller** than the
      hull-vertex set -- a conservative prefilter before an exact hull.

  Neither computes hull connectivity; for that use an exact hull library
  ([`scipy.spatial.ConvexHull`][] or the qhull-backed mesh packages).

Normals from [`estimate_normals`][triwarp.points.estimate_normals] are *unoriented* -- a plane fit
cannot pick a side. See [`triwarp.repair`][triwarp.repair] for orientation propagation.

One member here takes no cloud at all: [`vector_angle`][triwarp.points.vector_angle] is the unsigned
angle between two ``wp.vec3`` arrays, geometry rather than array structure, so
[`triwarp.array`][triwarp.array] is no better a home.

    Flag the points strictly on the normal's side of a plane.

    The unbounded selection primitive: one plane cuts space in two and this is the half the normal
    points into. Composes into a convex region by intersecting several masks, which is what makes it
    worth having next to the box query — a slab, a wedge or a frustum is a handful of these, and
    none of them needs a spatial index because every point is tested independently.

    Parameters
    ----------

    plane_normal

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.bool]

    Returns
    -------

        Length ``n`` unit normals on ``points.device``. When neither orientation
        argument is given, normals are oriented outward from the whole-cloud
        centroid — a best-effort global orientation valid for star-shaped clouds
        (Open3D leaves the sign arbitrary instead). Points with fewer than two

    """
    Local Outlier Probability (LoOP) of each point, in ``[0, 1]``.

    A point is an outlier to the extent that its own neighbourhood is *stretched* relative to the
    neighbourhoods of the points in it. Following Kriegel et al., each point gets a "standard
    distance" ``sigma`` (the RMS distance to its neighbours), a local factor
    ``plof = sigma / mean(sigma over the neighbourhood) - 1``, and a probability
    ``max(0, erf(plof / (nplof * sqrt(2))))`` where ``nplof = scale * sqrt(mean(plof^2))`` over the
    whole cloud. Because the normalization is cloud-wide, the score is comparable across points but
    **not** across clouds — it is a rank, calibrated so that a threshold near ``0.8`` selects the
    tail.

    This is the measure behind MeshLab's ``compute_selection_point_cloud_outliers``, whose own
    ``propthreshold`` default is ``0.8``; threshold the result to reproduce a selection:

    ```python
    from triwarp.kernels import array as kernel_array

    probability = tw.points.outlier_probability(neighbor_idx, neighbor_distance)
    outlier_mask = wp.empty(probability.shape, dtype=wp.bool, device=probability.device)
    wp.map(kernel_array.greater, probability, wp.float32(0.8), out=outlier_mask)
    outliers = tw.array.flatnonzero(outlier_mask)
    ```

    Parameters
    ----------
    neighbor_idx
        ``(n, k)`` int32 neighbour table, as returned by
        [`query_nearest`][triwarp.neighbors.query_nearest] (unused slots marked ``-1``).
        A self-query table includes each point itself, which is counted normally — the same
        convention MeshLab's k-d tree query uses.
    neighbor_distance
        ``(n, k)`` float32 distances aligned with ``neighbor_idx``; unused slots are ``inf``.
    scale
        The LoOP normalization factor ``lambda``. Larger values make the score more conservative
        (fewer points near ``1``). MeshLab fixes it at ``3``, which is the default here.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.float32]
        Length-``n`` probabilities on ``neighbor_idx.device``. A point whose neighbour row is empty
        scores ``0``. All-zeros when the cloud has no spread at all.

    Raises

    Open3D's ``remove_statistical_outlier`` criterion, and the cheaper cousin of
    [`outlier_probability`][triwarp.points.outlier_probability]: one global threshold on a single
    per-point statistic rather than a neighbourhood-relative one. It is the right choice for a
    cloud of roughly uniform density and the wrong one for a cloud that is dense in places and
    sparse in others, where the sparse region is entirely above a global threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    neighbor_distance
        ``(n, k)`` float32 distances from
        [`query_nearest`][triwarp.neighbors.query_nearest]; unused slots are ``inf`` and
        are excluded from the per-point mean. A self-query table contributes one zero distance per
        row, exactly as Open3D's ``SearchKNN`` does, so pass the same ``k`` Open3D gets as
        ``nb_neighbors``.
    std_ratio
        Multiplier on the cloud-wide standard deviation of the per-point means. Lower is stricter.
        Open3D's own examples use ``2.0``, the default here.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.bool]
        Length-``n`` mask on ``neighbor_distance.device``; ``True`` marks an **outlier** (the

    Open3D's ``remove_radius_outlier`` criterion, and the local counterpart of

    floor rather than a cloud-wide threshold on a per-point statistic. That makes it the right
    choice where the density is known in advance (a scanner's nominal spacing) and the wrong one
    where it varies across the cloud, which is the trade the two run in opposite directions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points
        ``(n,)`` point positions as ``wp.array[wp.vec3]``.
    radius
        Search radius, inclusive at exactly ``radius``. Must be ``> 0``.
    min_neighbors
        A point survives when it has **strictly more** than this many neighbours, counting
        *itself* — Open3D's ``nb_points`` rule exactly, so the same number gives the same answer.
        Must be ``>= 1``.
    grid
        Optional pre-built hash grid over ``points``, from
        [`hashgrid_from_points`][triwarp.neighbors.hashgrid_from_points]. Pass it to hoist the
        build out of a sweep over several radii.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.bool]
        Length-``n`` mask on ``points.device``; ``True`` marks an **outlier** (the complement of

    RuntimeError
        If ``points`` and ``grid`` are not all on one device.

    Notes
    -----
    The counts are exact, and the rule is the reference's -- but Open3D's own
    ``remove_radius_outlier`` shares one ``KDTreeFlann`` across an OpenMP loop and its radius search
    is not thread-safe under that sharing, so it returns a *different answer run to run*, differing
    by a point or two between repetitions of the same cloud. Querying the same tree serially
    reproduces this function exactly. Expect a comparison against the filter to disagree on a
    handful of borderline points, and do not read that as a difference in the criterion.

    Flag every point that repeats an **exactly** equal position seen earlier in the cloud.

    Open3D's ``remove_duplicated_points`` rule: bit-for-bit coordinate equality, keeping the
    *first* occurrence of each distinct position. This is deliberately not
    [`triwarp.grouping.unique_rows`][triwarp.grouping.unique_rows], whose ``wp.vec3`` key buckets
    each coordinate to about ``2.4e-4`` relative and so merges positions that are merely close;
    reach for that one when a *tolerance* is what you want, and for this one when equality is.

    One hashed pass does it: each point probes an open-addressing table of point indices and
    compares a candidate's three coordinate bit patterns against its own, so a hash collision is
    never read as a duplicate, and the table keeps each position's smallest index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points
        ``(n,)`` point positions as ``wp.array[wp.vec3]``.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.bool]
        Length-``n`` mask on ``points.device``; ``True`` marks a **duplicate**, i.e. every
        occurrence but the first of each distinct position. Gathering by the complement keeps one
        representative of each in first-occurrence order, as Open3D does.

    Notes
    -----
    ``-0.0`` and ``+0.0`` merge, because IEEE-754 equality holds between them and the reference
    compares with ``==``; the packing folds the two bit patterns together to reproduce that.
    ``NaN`` is the one case that does **not** match the reference: ``NaN != NaN`` makes every
    ``NaN`` row its own class for Open3D, where a bit pattern is a bit pattern here and identical
    ``NaN`` rows merge. Run [`point_finite_mask`][triwarp.points.point_finite_mask] first and the
    question does not arise. Positions are compared at ``float32``, so two points that differ only
    below ``float32`` resolution are one position here and two for a ``float64`` reference.

def farthest_point_sample(
    points: wp.array[wp.vec3], count: int, *, start: int = 0
) -> wp.array[wp.int32]:
    """
    Greedily pick ``count`` points, each as far as possible from those already picked.

    Open3D's ``farthest_point_down_sample``: the classic maximin subsample, which spreads its
    output over the cloud's *support* rather than its density — so unlike
    [`triwarp.voxels.voxel_down_sample`][triwarp.voxels.voxel_down_sample] it returns an exact
    count, and unlike a random subsample it cannot leave a hole. The greedy choice makes it
    inherently sequential in ``count``, and the whole sweep runs as **one persistent block** on the
    device: each round folds the newest sample into every point's running distance and takes the
    global arg-max as a block reduction, so nothing is launched or read back per round.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points
        ``(n,)`` point positions as ``wp.array[wp.vec3]``.
    count
        Number of points to select; must satisfy ``0 <= count <= n``. Zero returns an empty array,
        as Open3D's ``num_samples=0`` does.
    start
        Index of the first sample, Open3D's ``start_index``. Defaults to ``0``, which is its
        default too.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.int32]
        Length-``count`` indices into ``points``, on ``points.device``, in **selection order**:
        entry 0 is ``start`` and each later entry is the point farthest from every earlier one.
        Open3D returns the selected *points* instead, and its ``SelectByIndex`` emits them in
        ascending index order, so the sequence here is strictly more information than the reference
        gives back — the sets are the same.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``count`` is not in ``[0, n]``, or ``start`` is not a valid index into ``points``.

    Notes
    -----
    Ties are broken towards the lower index, matching the reference's strict ``>`` arg-max, and that
    is what makes the answer reproducible: the per-iteration arg-max is a single ``wp.atomic_max``
    over a key that packs the squared distance against the complemented index, so the winner does
    not depend on the order the atomics land in. Distances are compared in ``float32`` where Open3D
    uses ``float64``, so a cloud with two points at nearly equal distance from the chosen set can
    diverge from that reference at the point where the tie is resolved — and then, being greedy, for
    the rest of the sequence.

def convex_subset_mask(
    points: wp.array[wp.vec3], n_directions: int = 128, tolerance: float = 1e-6
) -> wp.array[wp.bool]:
    """
    Approximate the convex-hull vertices of a point cloud as a boolean mask.

    For any direction ``n``, the point maximizing ``⟨n, p⟩`` is a vertex of the convex hull, and the
    point minimizing it is the hull vertex farthest along ``-n``. A single dot-product sweep
    therefore yields the two hull vertices supporting ``+n`` and ``-n``. Directions are drawn on the
    positive-``z`` hemisphere with the deterministic Fibonacci spiral
    ([`sample_fibonacci_hemisphere`][triwarp.sample.sample_fibonacci_hemisphere]); because the
    hemisphere and its reflection tile the full sphere, taking both the max and min per direction
    covers all ``2 * n_directions`` antipodal orientations at half the cost of sampling the full
    sphere.

    The extrema are computed by one thread per ``(direction, point slice)``, each reducing a strided
    slice of [`ITEMS_PER_SLICE_CUDA`][triwarp.constants.ITEMS_PER_SLICE_CUDA] points
    (``ITEMS_PER_SLICE_CPU`` on the CPU device) and committing one atomic, then a second pass marks
    the maximizers and minimizers. At most roughly ``2 * n_directions`` points (plus ties) can be
    marked.

    !!! warning "The result is an inner approximation, not a superset"

        Marking a point requires a *certificate* -- a sampled direction it is extremal along -- so a
        hull vertex with no such direction is **dropped**. The mask is therefore a subset of the
        hull boundary, never a conservative superset of the hull vertices; see Notes for the exact
        guarantee and how to raise recall. When losing a hull vertex is unacceptable, use
        [`convex_superset_mask`][triwarp.points.convex_superset_mask], which errs the other way by
        construction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points
        ``(n_points,)`` point positions on the target device.
    n_directions
        Number of Fibonacci hemisphere directions. Each covers two antipodal
        orientations, so the effective coverage is ``2 * n_directions``. Larger
        values recover more of the hull vertices.
    tolerance
        Relative slack on the support test; a point is marked when its dot product
        with a direction is within ``tolerance * (max - min)`` of that direction's
        maximum or minimum, where ``max - min`` is the cloud's support extent along
        the direction. Scaling the slack with the extent captures coplanar ties and
        float32 roundoff at any coordinate scale.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.bool]
        Length-``n_points`` mask on ``points.device``; ``True`` for points selected
        as approximate hull vertices. Empty when there are no points.

    Notes
    -----
    **What is guaranteed.** Every marked point lies on the convex-hull *boundary*, to within the
    ``tolerance`` slack. That is the invariant that holds for every input. The stronger statement --
    every marked point is a hull *vertex* -- holds only when no support direction ties, which is the
    generic case for a cloud in general position but fails on structured data: on a grid over each
    face of a cube the mask also returns the face-edge midpoints that tie with a corner along a face
    normal, at any ``n_directions``. Raising ``tolerance`` widens that effect deliberately.

    **What is not guaranteed.** A hull vertex is recovered only when a sampled direction falls
    inside its *normal cone*, so recall degrades with the flatness of the hull around a vertex, not
    with the point count. On 500 standard-normal points (31 hull vertices) the recovered fraction
    measures 0.61 at ``n_directions=32``, 0.87 at 256 and 1.00 at 16384; the vertices missed at 256
    have normal cones spanning a few parts in ten thousand of the sphere or less. Increasing
    ``n_directions`` is the only knob that raises recall -- ``tolerance`` trades precision for it
    and is not a substitute. When *all* hull vertices are required, use an exact hull
    ([`scipy.spatial.ConvexHull`][] and the qhull-backed mesh libraries): no setting of these
    parameters makes this function conservative.

    """
    Conservatively discard interior points, keeping a superset of the convex-hull vertices.

    Unlike [`convex_subset_mask`][triwarp.points.convex_subset_mask], which keeps only points it can
    *prove* are on the hull, this keeps every point it cannot prove is *interior*. The certificate
    is a tetrahedron: the support point of the cloud along each direction of an
    [`icosphere`][triwarp.creation.icosphere] is a hull vertex, so for every triangle ``(a, b, c)``
    of the icosphere the tetrahedron ``(centroid, s_a, s_b, s_c)`` has all four corners in the hull
    and therefore lies inside it. Any point strictly inside such a tetrahedron is strictly inside
    the hull and cannot be a hull vertex; every other point is kept.

    Because a hull vertex lies on the hull *boundary*, it is in no tetrahedron's strict interior, so
    **no hull vertex is ever discarded** -- for any input, any ``subdivisions``, and any ``margin``.
    The parameters trade only how many interior points survive. That makes this a prefilter: run it,
    then hand the survivors to an exact hull, which then does its superlinear work on a small
    fraction of the cloud.

    Cost is one support sweep (``n_points`` times the ``10 * 4 ** subdivisions + 2`` icosphere
    directions) plus one pass testing each point against the ``20 * 4 ** subdivisions``
    tetrahedra, whose precomputed face planes every thread reads in lockstep.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points
        ``(n_points,)`` point positions on the target device.
    subdivisions
        Icosphere refinement level for the direction set, which also fixes the tetrahedron count.
        Higher values wrap the hull more tightly and so discard more interior points, at a
        proportionally higher cost; the guarantee is unaffected.
    margin
        Distance, as a fraction of the shell radius, by which a point must clear all four faces of a
        tetrahedron to count as strictly inside it. Raising it keeps *more* points, so it can only
        weaken the filter, never the guarantee. The default is set by float32 arithmetic rather than
        by taste: a point lying *exactly* on a face must not be read as inside. See Notes.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.bool]
        Length-``n_points`` mask on ``points.device``; ``True`` for points that may be hull
        vertices, which includes every actual hull vertex. Empty when there are no points.

    Notes
    -----
    Selectivity depends strongly on the cloud's shape: a near-spherical cloud keeps a small
    fraction of its points (a triangulated inner shell hugs it tightly), while a flat-faced cloud
    keeps far more, because the shell cannot hug a plane and the survivors form a thin slab under
    each face.

    The guarantee is exact in real arithmetic; in float32 it rests on ``margin`` covering the error
    in the plane evaluation. Values of ``margin`` below ``1e-6`` can discard a true hull vertex --
    always a point lying *essentially exactly* on a tetrahedron face, where the computed distance
    straddles zero -- while ``1e-6`` and above are clean; the ``1e-5`` default sits well above that
    boundary, at a small cost in selectivity. ``TETRAHEDRON_FLATNESS`` is the other half of the
    same protection: it discards sliver tetrahedra whose face normals are too ill-conditioned to
    trust, and without it no margin in this range is safe.

    Degenerate input is handled by the same conservative logic rather than by a special case. A
    coplanar or collinear cloud makes every tetrahedron flat; flat tetrahedra are rejected as
    ill-conditioned, so nothing is certified interior and every point is kept, which is a valid
    (if useless) superset. Fewer than four points returns an all-``True`` mask directly.
