"""
Flatten a mesh into the plane: harmonic, Tutte, ARAP and LSCM parametrizations.

Four maps, differing in what they hold fixed and what they minimize. The first three pin the
boundary and solve for the interior:
[`harmonic`][triwarp.parametrization.harmonic] minimizes Dirichlet energy with cotangent weights,
[`tutte`][triwarp.parametrization.tutte] is the same solve with uniform weights (guaranteeing an
injective map for a convex boundary), and [`arap`][triwarp.parametrization.arap] alternates local
rotation fits with a global solve to trade conformality for low area distortion.
[`lscm`][triwarp.parametrization.lscm] instead pins only two vertices and lets the boundary find its
own shape, minimizing conformal rather than Dirichlet energy.

[`map_vertices_to_circle`][triwarp.parametrization.map_vertices_to_circle] supplies the boundary
condition the fixed-boundary three need, and
[`face_flipped_indices`][triwarp.parametrization.face_flipped_indices] is the diagnostic that
says whether a result is actually injective. Ports of the corresponding ``igl::`` routines; every
solve is conjugate-gradient.

    """
    Per-face flag: whether a triangle is inverted (negative 2D signed area) in the parametrization.

    For each triangle the 2D signed area of its three UV vertices is computed; a face is flagged
    ``True`` when that area is strictly negative, i.e. the triangle has folded over (flipped
    orientation) in the 2D domain. Mirrors libigl's ``flipped_triangles`` per-triangle test
    (determinant of the homogeneous ``3 x 3`` vertex matrix ``< 0``). Degenerate (zero-area)
    triangles are **not** flagged, matching the strict ``< 0`` comparison.
    [`face_flipped_indices`][triwarp.parametrization.face_flipped_indices] is the index form of
    this mask.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` 2D vertex positions (the parametrization / UV coordinates) as ``wp.vec2``.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.bool]
        Length ``n_faces`` on ``vertices.device``. Empty for an empty mesh.

    Notes
    -----
    Equivalent to the per-triangle predicate behind libigl ``flipped_triangles``: the 2D cross
    product ``(v1 - v0) x (v2 - v0)`` equals ``det([[x0, x1, x2], [y0, y1, y2], [1, 1, 1]])``, so a
    ``True`` entry corresponds exactly to a triangle libigl would list as flipped.

    This is a different flip from
    [`face_flip_mask`][triwarp.validation.face_flip_mask], which is about the *3D winding*: this
    mask flags a triangle whose UV image has folded over, a property of the parametrization that
    says nothing about the surface, while that one flags a triangle whose index order must be
    reversed to agree with its patch. A mesh can be consistently wound and still have flipped UVs,
    and vice versa.

    step fits, per triangle, the closest rotation between the isometrically flattened rest triangle

    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    fixed_indices
        ``wp.int32`` indices of the pinned (constrained) vertices — libigl's ``b``. At least one is
        required whenever the mesh has interior vertices (the ARAP global system is otherwise a
        singular, translation-invariant Poisson problem). Pinning the whole boundary loop reproduces
        the classic fixed-boundary ARAP disk parametrization.
    fixed_uv
        ``(n_fixed,)`` target UV positions for ``fixed_indices``, in the same order — libigl's
        ``bc``.
    uv_init
        ``(n_vertices,)`` initial UV coordinates (the warm start). Never mutated; the interior
        values seed the first local step and the conjugate-gradient warm start, and the pinned rows
        are
        overwritten with ``fixed_uv`` before the first iteration.
    max_iterations
        Number of local/global iterations (``>= 1``). libigl defaults to ``10``.
    tolerance
        Relative residual tolerance of the inner conjugate-gradient solve (``> 0``). See Notes for
        why the default is looser than the ``1e-8`` the other solvers in this module use.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.vec2]
        ``(n_vertices,)`` UV coordinates on ``vertices.device``. Empty for an empty mesh. Rows at
        ``fixed_indices`` equal ``fixed_uv`` exactly.

    ------
    ValueError

    Notes
    -----
    Uses the *elements* ARAP energy (one rotation per triangle), libigl's default for the flat
    ``dim = 2`` parametrization case; the covariance scatter is built per corner of the flattened
    mesh, which is why the ``SPOKES`` / ``SPOKES_AND_RIMS`` (per-vertex) energies do not apply here.
    The half-cotangent weights ``c_e`` come from
    [`cotmatrix_entries`][triwarp.laplacian.cotmatrix_entries] with no clamping (matching libigl),
    and the closest 2D rotation is the closed form ``theta = atan2(S10 - S01, S00 + S11)`` of
    ``igl::fit_rotations_planar`` (libigl's scale-invariant ``S /= max|S|`` normalization is
    unnecessary for ``atan2`` and is skipped). The cotangent operator and the two conjugate-gradient
    solves run in float64 for determinism while the UV field is stored ``float32`` between
    iterations (module convention); the ~1e-7/iteration drift is well under the pinned-boundary
    tolerance for the default iteration count.

    **Why ``tolerance`` defaults to ``1e-7`` and not ``1e-8``.** Unlike
    [`harmonic`][triwarp.parametrization.harmonic] or [`lscm`][triwarp.parametrization.lscm], whose
    single solve *is* the answer, ARAP's global solves are inner steps of a truncated outer
    iteration, so solving more accurately than the outer iteration's own truncation error wastes
    work without changing the result. Pass ``tolerance=1e-8`` for stricter per-iteration solves;
    going looser than the default risks the inner error exceeding the outer truncation error on
    large meshes, which is why ``1e-7`` rather than something looser is the default.

    Constrained least-squares conformal map.

    Computes the conformal (angle-preserving) parametrization that minimizes the LSCM (Levy)
    conformal energy subject to a set of pinned vertices, by solving a single quadratic program
    over the stacked ``[u; v]`` vector of ``2 * n_vertices`` unknowns with the LSCM Hessian
    [`lscm_hessian`][triwarp.energies.lscm_hessian] as the operator. Unlike
    [`harmonic`][triwarp.parametrization.harmonic] / [`tutte`][triwarp.parametrization.tutte] (which
    pin the whole boundary and solve two independent columns), LSCM couples ``u`` and ``v`` through
    the boundary vector-area term, so it needs only a few pins — typically **two** — to fix the
    remaining similarity-transform (rotation + scale + translation) degree of freedom.

    The interior system is solved with conjugate gradient. Closed meshes are valid input: the
    boundary vector-area matrix is then zero and the
    Hessian reduces to ``-repdiag(L, 2)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    pinned_indices
        ``wp.int32`` indices of the pinned (constrained) vertices — igl's ``b``. At least two are
        required (unless the mesh has fewer than two vertices) to remove the conformal map's
        similarity-transform null space.
    pinned_uv
        ``(n_pinned,)`` target UV positions for ``pinned_indices``, in the same order (igl's
        ``bc``).

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.vec2]
        ``(n_vertices,)`` UV coordinates on ``vertices.device``. Empty for an empty mesh.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If fewer than two vertices are pinned (and the mesh has at least two vertices), or if
        ``pinned_indices`` and ``pinned_uv`` have different lengths.
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices``, ``faces``, ``pinned_indices`` and ``pinned_uv`` are not all on one device.

    See Also
    --------

    [`harmonic`][triwarp.parametrization.harmonic]
    [`face_flipped_indices`][triwarp.parametrization.face_flipped_indices]

    Notes
    -----
    The unknowns are stacked ``[u; v]`` (all ``u`` DOFs then all ``v`` DOFs), matching igl's
    ``lscm``: pin ``i`` fixes DOF ``i`` (``u``) and DOF ``i + n_vertices`` (``v``). The returned
    ``Q`` of ``igl.lscm`` equals ``-repdiag(L, 2) - 2 A`` exactly (see
    [`lscm_hessian`][triwarp.energies.lscm_hessian]).
