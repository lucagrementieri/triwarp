"""
Per-vertex quantities: normals under three weighting rules, and the angle defect.

A vertex has no normal of its own -- only the faces around it do -- so a vertex normal is always a
weighted average of incident face normals, and the weight is a modelling choice rather than a
detail. [`vertex_normals`][triwarp.vertices.vertex_normals] is the entry point, and its
``weighting=`` keyword *is* that choice: by face area, by incident angle (the one invariant to how a
neighbouring polygon happened to be triangulated), or by Nelson Max's sine-and-edge-length
reciprocals.

Two **accumulators** sit underneath it and are public in their own right:
[`weighted_vertex_normals`][triwarp.vertices.weighted_vertex_normals] takes a caller-supplied
per-corner weight table and [`mean_vertex_normals`][triwarp.vertices.mean_vertex_normals] is the
same thing with unit weights. They know no geometry -- they take no ``vertices`` at all, which is
why they keep an explicit ``n_vertices`` argument where ``vertex_normals`` derives it. That
asymmetry is the visible marker of which of the two layers you are in.

[`vertex_defects`][triwarp.vertices.vertex_defects] is the odd one out and not a normal at all:
``2 * pi`` minus the incident angle sum, which is the intrinsic curvature concentrated at that
vertex and the quantity
[`discrete_gaussian_curvature`][triwarp.curvature.discrete_gaussian_curvature] reports.

    Scatter per-face vectors onto their corners and unit-normalize the sums.

    The shared body of the module's two primitives: the scatter kernel decides whether each face
    contributes its vector once or scaled by a per-corner weight, and the other three public
    functions reach this through one of them.

    Accumulation is ``float64`` in an ``(n_vertices, 3)`` buffer even though both the input and the
    answer are ``float32``, which is what makes the result reproducible run to run on a CUDA device
    -- a float atomic's summation order is the scheduler's, and a ``float32`` accumulator turns
    that into about one ULP of movement per run. The reasoning and the measurements are at
    ``kernels.scatter.atomic_add_vec3``. The narrowing is a real kernel rather than the zero-copy
    ``wp.utils.array_cast`` reinterpretation a ``float32`` accumulator allowed, and it absorbs the
    normalization, so this costs one launch fewer than the pair it replaced.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_vertices
        Output length.
    faces
        Flat ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer; reshaped to ``(f, 3)`` for the scatter.
    scatter_table
        ``kernels.scatter`` overload table whose kernel takes ``(values, faces2d, *extra,
        out_sums)`` -- the face table is the *second* argument in that family, not the last input.
        Both of them are generic over the accumulator's precision, so the table is keyed by it.
    values
        ``(f,)`` per-face vectors to accumulate.
    extra
        Any further per-face arrays the kernel takes between the face table and the output, such as
        ``scatter_weighted_sum_vec``'s per-corner weights.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.vec3]
        Length-``n_vertices`` unit normals; zero where the accumulated vector was zero.

    Notes

    The launch ``dim`` is taken from ``faces``, not from ``values``: every array here is indexed by
    the face, and ``faces`` is the only one of them whose length also bounds the *gather* the

    Per-vertex unit normals, as a weighted average of the incident face normals.

    A vertex has no normal of its own -- only the faces around it do -- so the weight is the whole
    content of the choice, and ``weighting`` selects it. Contributions are summed per vertex and
    L2-normalized, so any constant factor in the weights cancels.

    Which weighting to want is a measurable question, not a preference: one reference library
    ships both conventions as separate entry points, and its plain per-vertex normals reproduce
    ``"area"`` to **1.19e-07** while its pseudo-normals reproduce ``"angle"`` to **1.19e-07** --
    each sitting **6.8e-03** from the other's partner, so the two are distinguishable well above
    float32 noise. Reach for ``"angle"`` when the answer must not depend on
    how a neighbouring polygon happened to be triangulated -- it is the only one of the three that
    is invariant to that -- and for ``"area"`` otherwise, since it is what libigl and most of the
    field default to.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions. The output length is ``vertices.shape[0]``.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    weighting
        Which average to take.

        - ``"area"`` (default) weights each face by its area, matching libigl's default
          ``per_vertex_normals`` (up to the constant ``2`` from ``doublearea``, which normalization
          cancels).
        - ``"angle"`` weights each face by its interior angle at the corner vertex -- the
          Thuerrner/Wuethrich recipe (*Computing Vertex Normals from Polygonal Facets*, Journal of
          Graphics Tools 3:1, 43-46, 1998) and
          ``igl::PER_VERTEX_NORMALS_WEIGHTING_TYPE_ANGLE``. The triangulation-invariant one.
        - ``"mwselr"`` weights each corner by ``sin(angle) / (||E_i|| ||E_{i+1}||)``, which reduces
          to ``(e1 x e2) / (||e1||^2 ||e2||^2)`` for the two outgoing edges -- Nelson Max's Mean
          Weighted by Sine and Edge Length Reciprocals, optimized for smooth surface reconstruction
          (Jin et al., 2005).
    face_normals
        Precomputed ``(n_faces,)`` face normals, to skip deriving them. Under ``"mwselr"``, passing
        them asserts they are *unit* length; omitting them lets the unnormalized cross product be
        used instead, which is cheaper and gives the same answer after normalization.
    face_weights
        Precomputed weights, to skip deriving them. The expected shape follows ``weighting``:
        ``(n_faces,)`` per-face areas for ``"area"``, and ``(n_faces, 3)`` per-corner angles for
        ``"angle"``. Not accepted under ``"mwselr"``, whose weights are a joint function of the
        corner positions rather than a table a caller would hold.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.vec3]
        Length-``n_vertices`` unit normals on ``vertices.device``, zero wherever the accumulated
        vector was zero (an unreferenced vertex, or a cancelling fan).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``weighting`` is not one of the three names, if ``face_weights`` is passed with
        ``weighting="mwselr"``, or if a supplied ``face_normals`` / ``face_weights`` does not have
