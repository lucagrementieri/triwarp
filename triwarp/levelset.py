"""
Surfaces from scalar fields, and the surface operations whose answer is a *different* surface.

[`marching_cubes`][triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes] is the primitive: the ``iso`` level set of a
dense lattice, as a triangle mesh. It is the extraction tail of every implicit-surface pipeline in
the package -- [`proximity.signed_distance_grid`][triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_grid],
[`voxels.to_field`][triwarp.voxels.to_field],
[`reconstruction.screened_poisson`][triwarp.reconstruction.screened_poisson] and
[`reconstruction.resample_uniform`][triwarp.reconstruction.resample_uniform] all end in it -- which
is why it lives here with its consumers rather than with the point-cloud reconstructors: none of
those callers is reconstructing from a cloud, they are extracting a level set.

[`offset_mesh`][triwarp.levelset.offset_mesh] moves a closed surface a fixed distance along its own
normal direction, in the only way that stays well defined where the surface curves back on itself:
through the signed distance field, whose level set at ``d`` is exactly the set of points at distance
``d`` -- so it is ``marching_cubes`` over a shifted SDF. That is why an offset lives here rather
than in [`triwarp.remesh`][triwarp.remesh] -- it is not a vertex displacement, and its output
topology is not the input's. A sphere offset inward past its radius vanishes; a thin plate offset
outward merges into one shell. Both are correct, and no per-vertex method produces either.

[`thicken_mesh`][triwarp.levelset.thicken_mesh] is the *topology-preserving* counterpart and the one
member here that is **not** a level-set operation -- it earns its place by being the contrast. For
the common case where an open surface has to become a solid of known thickness and the input's own
triangulation should survive, it extrudes along the vertex normals and closes the rim, so the output
is the input plus a copy plus a band. Nothing is resampled and no field is built, which is exactly
what ``offset_mesh`` cannot promise and exactly why the two are shelved together: the choice between
them is the choice between keeping the triangulation and keeping the distance. It can self-intersect
where the thickness exceeds the local radius of curvature, and it does not guard against that --
[`triwarp.validation.face_self_intersecting_mask`][triwarp.validation.face_self_intersecting_mask]
names the condition exactly, and repairing it is a separate operation.

For the fields these consume, see
[`triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_grid`][triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_grid]; for the binary
occupancy lattice, [`triwarp.voxels`][triwarp.voxels].

    """
    Extract the ``iso`` level set of a dense scalar lattice as a triangle mesh.

    The extraction tail of every implicit-surface pipeline, exposed on its own so a caller with a
    field of their own — an SDF, an occupancy volume, a simulation state — does not have to route it
    through [`reconstruction.screened_poisson`][triwarp.reconstruction.screened_poisson] to get a
    surface out. It is what
    [`reconstruction.resample_uniform`][triwarp.reconstruction.resample_uniform] is built from.

    Parameters
    ----------
    field
        ``(nx, ny, nz)`` ``wp.float32`` lattice of scalar values, with ``x`` the slowest axis. The
        surface is extracted where the field crosses ``iso``; the sign convention is the caller's,
        and the winding follows it (with triwarp's outside-positive
        [`signed_distance_on_mesh`][triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_on_mesh] convention the
        normals come out pointing outward).
    iso
        Level to extract. Defaults to ``0``, which is the zero level set of a signed distance field.
    bounds
        ``(lower, upper)`` world-space corners the lattice spans, so ``field[0, 0, 0]`` sits at
        ``lower`` and ``field[nx - 1, ny - 1, nz - 1]`` at ``upper``. When ``None`` the result is in
        *index* space: vertex coordinates are lattice indices.

    Returns
    -------
    vertices : wp.array[wp.vec3]
        Level-set vertices on ``field.device``. Empty when the field does not cross ``iso``.
    faces : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Flat ``3 * n_faces`` triangle index buffer.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``field`` is not a rank-3 ``wp.float32`` array, or any of its dimensions is below 2.

    Notes
    -----
    A thin wrapper over Warp's own ``warp.MarchingCubes``, so the triangulation, its vertex
    deduplication and its handling of the ambiguous cube cases are Warp's rather than triwarp's. The
    consequence worth knowing is that the result is **not guaranteed manifold** at an ambiguous
    cell, and can carry duplicate vertices where two cells agree on a crossing —
    [`reconstruction.resample_uniform`][triwarp.reconstruction.resample_uniform] runs
    [`triwarp.repair`][triwarp.repair] over it for exactly that reason.

    Offset a surface by a signed distance, through the level set of its distance field.

    Positive grows the solid, negative shrinks it. The result is the exact set of points at distance
    ``distance`` from the input, sampled at ``voxel_size`` -- so it handles the cases a per-vertex
    displacement cannot: a shrink that makes a thin feature disappear, a growth that merges two
    nearby sheets into one, and any offset of a surface with concave regions, where neighbouring
    vertices moving along their own normals would cross.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer. Should describe a closed
        surface; an open one still offsets, but only ``sign_mode="winding"`` gives it a meaningful
        inside.
    distance
        Signed offset. Positive is outward.
    voxel_size
        Lattice spacing for the distance field. ``None`` derives it from ``distance`` --
        ``|distance| / 3``, so three samples span the band the level set has to be found in --
        clamped to between 64 and 256 samples across the mesh's bounding-box diagonal. The lower
        bound matters: a *large* inward offset leaves a small object, and a spacing set by the
        distance alone can be coarser than what is left of it.
    sign_mode
        Forwarded to
        [`triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_grid`][triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_grid]. Defaults
        to ``"winding"`` rather than ``"parity"``: an offset of a mesh with a few open rims is a
        common ask, and parity is the mode that goes wrong on one.
    bounds
        ``(lower, upper)`` box to sample before padding. ``None`` uses the mesh's own box, which the
        padding then extends to cover the offset.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[wp.array[wp.vec3], wp.array[wp.int32]]
        ``(vertices, faces)`` of the offset surface on ``vertices.device``. **Empty** when the level
        set does not exist -- an inward offset larger than the object's own half-thickness has no
        points at that distance, which is the right answer rather than an error.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``distance`` is zero, ``voxel_size`` is not positive, or ``faces`` is empty.
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices`` and ``faces`` are not all on one device.

    Examples
    --------
    ```python
    grown_v, grown_f = tw.levelset.offset_mesh(v, f, 0.1)
    ```

    Notes
    -----
    **The defaults are the whole value of this function over composing the two calls it makes.** The
    field has to extend past the level set being extracted or that level set is clipped by the
    lattice boundary, so the padding is ``ceil(distance / voxel_size) + 2`` cells for an outward
    offset; and the spacing has to resolve the band, which is what ties it to ``distance`` rather
    than to the mesh. Getting either wrong yields a *plausible* surface with a hole in it, which is
    why they are computed here rather than left to the caller.

    The output is a resampled surface: its triangulation is the marching-cubes lattice's, not the
    input's, and its vertex count is set by ``voxel_size`` rather than by the input's. Where the
    input's own triangulation must survive, the operation wanted is
    [`thicken_mesh`][triwarp.levelset.thicken_mesh], not this.

    Accuracy is the lattice's, improved by marching cubes' linear interpolation across a cell.

    """
    Turn a surface into a solid shell of given thickness, keeping the input's triangulation.

    The counterpart of [`offset_mesh`][triwarp.levelset.offset_mesh] for the case where the answer
    should still be *this* mesh: every vertex is displaced along its own angle-weighted normal, a
    reversed copy of the surface becomes the shell's other side, and the two are joined along every
    boundary edge by a quad band. So the output is the input's connectivity twice over plus the band
    -- ``2 * n_faces + 2 * n_boundary_edges`` triangles -- and a per-vertex attribute follows
    through by duplication, which no resampled offset allows.

    On a **closed** surface there is no boundary to band, so the result is two nested shells: a
    solid with a cavity, which is what thickening a closed surface means.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer, consistently wound. The
        winding is what decides which side is "outside", so an inconsistent input gives a shell
        turned inside out in places -- run
        [`triwarp.repair.make_winding_consistent`][triwarp.repair.make_winding_consistent] first.
    thickness
        Distance the shell extends **inward**, opposite the vertex normals. Must be positive.
    outside
        Distance the shell also extends outward, so the input surface ends up ``outside`` in from
        the outer face. Zero (the default) leaves the input surface as the outer face exactly.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[wp.array[wp.vec3], wp.array[wp.int32]]
        ``(vertices, faces)`` on ``vertices.device``: ``2 * n_vertices`` positions -- the outward
        layer first, then the inward one, so input vertex ``v`` is at ``v`` and at
        ``v + n_vertices`` -- and ``2 * n_faces + 2 * n_boundary_edges`` triangles.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``thickness`` is not positive, ``outside`` is negative, or ``faces`` is empty.
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices`` and ``faces`` are not all on one device.

    Examples
    --------
    ```python
    shell_v, shell_f = tw.levelset.thicken_mesh(v, f, 0.05)
    ```

    Notes
    -----
    **It can self-intersect, and it does not check.** Displacing along vertex normals folds the
    surface wherever ``thickness`` exceeds the local radius of curvature -- the inward layer of a
    tube thickened past its own radius passes through itself -- and no per-vertex method avoids
    that.
    The condition is exactly
    [`triwarp.validation.face_self_intersecting_mask`][triwarp.validation.face_self_intersecting_mask],
    so it is detectable in one call; where it happens, the operation wanted is a level-set
    [`offset_mesh`][triwarp.levelset.offset_mesh], which cannot self-intersect by construction. Not
    guarding is deliberate: the guard would be a whole-mesh intersection test on every call, and the
    caller who needs it can run the one that names the faces.

    The normals are **angle-weighted** (the pseudonormal), which is the weighting that makes the
    displacement independent of how the incident triangles happen to be subdivided;
    [`triwarp.vertices`][triwarp.vertices] documents the four choices.
