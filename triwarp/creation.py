"""
Parametric mesh generators: boxes, Platonic solids, surfaces of revolution and extrusions.

Every function returns a bare ``(vertices, faces)`` pair using triwarp's flat ``(3 * n_faces,)``
face layout, so results feed straight into the rest of the package or into
[`Trimesh`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh] via ``tw.Trimesh(*tw.creation.box())``.

[`revolve`][triwarp.creation.revolve] is the engine behind most of the module:
[`uv_sphere`][triwarp.creation.uv_sphere], [`capsule`][triwarp.creation.capsule],
[`cylinder`][triwarp.creation.cylinder], [`cone`][triwarp.creation.cone],
[`annulus`][triwarp.creation.annulus] and [`torus`][triwarp.creation.torus] each build a small 2D
profile and sweep it around the Z axis. [`box`][triwarp.creation.box] and the four Platonic solids
([`tetrahedron`][triwarp.creation.tetrahedron], [`octahedron`][triwarp.creation.octahedron],
[`icosahedron`][triwarp.creation.icosahedron], [`dodecahedron`][triwarp.creation.dodecahedron]) are
constant tables, and [`icosphere`][triwarp.creation.icosphere] refines one of them in closed form.
[`grid`][triwarp.creation.grid] and
[`sphere_cap`][triwarp.creation.sphere_cap] are the two *open* primitives — a flat patch and a
curved one, each with exactly one boundary loop.

[`parametric_surface`][triwarp.creation.parametric_surface] and its three named siblings
([`super_ellipsoid`][triwarp.creation.super_ellipsoid],
[`super_toroid`][triwarp.creation.super_toroid],
[`random_hills`][triwarp.creation.random_hills]) sample an analytic map on an identified lattice,
and are the only builders here that produce a **non-orientable** surface, an odd Euler
characteristic, or a mesh whose scale is far from 1.

Each function carries the fixed host-side cost of a Warp wrapper call, so build a primitive once
and reuse it rather than calling these repeatedly in a loop.

    Create a flat, regularly triangulated rectangle in the ``z = 0`` plane.

    The cheapest mesh with interior vertices and a boundary loop, which is what makes it the
    default fixture for anything that needs one: parametrization, boundary conditions, texture
    baking. Every quad cell is split by the same diagonal, so both triangles of a cell are
    right-angled — be aware that this makes every diagonal's cotangent weight exactly zero, which
    some solvers are sensitive to.

    Parameters
    ----------
    count
        ``(nx, ny)`` **vertex** counts along X and Y; each must be at least 2. The result has
        ``nx * ny`` vertices and ``2 * (nx - 1) * (ny - 1)`` triangles.
    extents
        ``(width, height)`` total span along X and Y.
    center
        When ``True`` (the default) the patch spans ``[-extents / 2, extents / 2]``; when
        ``False`` its lower corner sits at the origin, matching MeshLab's ``create_grid``.
    transform
        Transform applied after construction, as a ``(1,)`` ``wp.mat44`` array or a scalar
        ``wp.mat44``. Face winding is reversed when the transform has negative determinant.
    device
        Warp device for the result. Defaults to the current device.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[wp.array[wp.vec3], wp.array[wp.int32]]
        ``(vertices, faces)`` on ``device``, wound so the normals point along ``+Z``.

    Both buffers are written **closed-form on the device**, one thread per vertex and one per quad
    cell, rather than assembled on the host. Positions come out **bit-identical** to a NumPy
    build: the kernel does the same arithmetic in ``float64`` before the ``float32`` store, and
    phrases each sample as ``extent * (k / (n - 1))`` so the far edge lands on the extent exactly,

    more work.

    Parameters
    ----------
    subdivisions
        Number of refinement levels. Face count grows as ``4 ** subdivisions``, so values above
        ~7 get expensive. Values ``<= 0`` return a plain icosahedron scaled to ``radius``.
    radius

    Notes
    -----
    The connectivity is generated in closed form rather than by iterating
    [`subdivide`][triwarp.remesh.subdivide]: every vertex of the refined mesh is addressed directly
    by its barycentric coordinates within one of the 20 base faces (see
    ``kernels.creation.icosphere_vertex_index``), so the whole face buffer is written by **one**
    kernel and the vertices by one launch per refinement level, with no host synchronization.

    The *geometry* is still the recursive one, level by level, because that is what the reference
    produces: a vertex is the projected midpoint of two vertices of the previous level, which is
    not the same point as the projection of the corresponding barycentric point of the base face
    (the two differ by a few percent of the edge length). Vertex *order* differs from trimesh —
    vertices come out as the 12 base corners, then the interior points of each base edge, then the
    interior points of each base face.

    The longitude count is doubled when ``count`` is given explicitly but not when it is left at

    64. This asymmetry is inherited from [`trimesh.creation.uv_sphere`][] and kept for parity.

    The two pole points are snapped to exactly ``(0, -radius)`` and ``(0, radius)`` in the 2D
    profile. ``sin(pi)`` is ``1.2e-16`` rather than zero, and without the snap the pole vertices
    of adjacent slices differ by ``1.2e-16 * radius`` — enough that the weld and the
    degenerate-triangle filter in [`revolve`][triwarp.creation.revolve] both start to fail at
    large radii. The correction is far below ``float32`` resolution.

    Parameters

    angle
        Polar half-angle of the cap in **radians**, measured from ``+Z``. Must be in ``(0, pi)``

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike [`uv_sphere`][triwarp.creation.uv_sphere], the longitude count is *not* doubled here.
    [`trimesh.creation.capsule`][]'s docstring describes the geometry as having one hemisphere at
    the origin and the other at ``height``; the implementation (and this port) centers it
    instead.

    The profile is two quarter-circles, each swept from the equator to a pole, rather than one
    continuous sweep from pole to pole: sharing the equator between two *exactly*
    ``cos(0) = 1``-radius points (one shifted to each hemisphere) is what gives the cylindrical
    wall between them an exact, constant radius, matching
    [`trimesh.creation.capsule`][]'s own construction (which does this for the same reason,
    per its own comment, "two quarter circles sharing an equator vertex"). A single pole-to-pole
    sweep only *approximates* the equator at the two points nearest ``latitude / 2``, which are a
    fraction of a section short of it, and reads as a nearly-vertical wall rather than an exactly
    vertical one; more concretely, it counts two fewer profile points than the exact
    construction, which shows up as a vertex-count mismatch against
    [`trimesh.creation.capsule`][] at every longitude count.

    Revolve a 2D profile around the 2D Y axis, which becomes the 3D Z axis.

    This is the shared engine behind every radially symmetric primitive in this module. The 2D X
    component of ``linestring`` is used as the revolution radius and the 2D Y component as the
    height along Z.

    Parameters
    ----------
    linestring
        ``(n,)`` ordered 2D profile points, ``n >= 2``. A closed profile should be wound
        counter-clockwise for outward-facing normals.
    angle
        Angle in radians to revolve through. ``None`` (the default) is a full revolution.
    cap
        For a partial revolution, triangulate the two end faces so the result is a closed volume.
        Ignored for a full revolution, which needs no caps. Requires a simple (non
        self-intersecting) profile — see
        [`triangulate_polygon`][triwarp.polyline.triangulate_polygon].
    sections
        Number of pie wedges around the revolution. Defaults to 32 per full revolution, scaled by
        ``angle``.
    transform
        Transform applied after construction, as a ``(1,)`` ``wp.mat44`` array or a scalar
        ``wp.mat44``. Face winding is reversed when its determinant is negative.

    Returns

    Raises

    RuntimeError
        If ``linestring`` and ``transform`` are not all on one device.

    Notes
    -----
    Two clean-up steps are part of the algorithm, not optional polish:

    - **Degenerate triangles are dropped.** Any template triangle whose area is at most ``1e-8``
      is discarded, which is how the polar triangles of a sphere, the apex and base fans of a
      cone, and the axis triangles of a cylinder disappear without being special-cased. The
      threshold is absolute, exactly as trimesh's ``tol.merge`` is, so a sphere's polar triangles
      stop registering as degenerate somewhere above ``radius = 1e4``. Build near unit scale and
      pass a scaling ``transform`` if you need the result large.
    - **Coincident vertices are collapsed**, which is what makes the result watertight: a cone
      apex, a sphere pole, and the closing point of a closed profile each appear once *per slice*
      beforehand. `trimesh` discovers these by position hashing (the ``merge_vertices`` pass of
      ``Trimesh(process=True)``); this port derives them from the profile instead — a profile
      point within ``1e-8`` of the axis becomes a single shared vertex, and a profile whose last
      point repeats its first shares that column. That is exact and scale independent, where a
      position hash both misses ``+0.0``/``-0.0`` pole pairs and starts merging genuinely distinct
      vertices at high section counts.

    A consequence of deriving the collapse rather than measuring it: a profile that repeats an
    *interior* point, or whose ends are close but not equal, keeps its duplicate vertices (the
    zero-area faces between them are still dropped, so they are simply unreferenced).

    Unlike [`trimesh.creation.extrude_triangulation`][], which samples the first ten triangles to
    decide the input winding, this averages the signed area of *every* triangle. The answer is the
    same for any consistently wound triangulation and does not depend on which triangles happen to
    come first.

    The walls index the cap vertices directly instead of carrying their own four-vertex quad per
    boundary edge, so the output is watertight with no vertex-merge pass (trimesh relies on
    ``Trimesh(process=True)`` to fuse the three blocks) and has exactly ``2 * n`` vertices.

    Create one of sixteen classical analytic surfaces by sampling its parameterization.

    These are the meshes with topology the rest of the module cannot produce: four are closed and

    other nine are open patches, several with strongly graded triangles. Their Euler characteristics

    [`is_orientable`][triwarp.validation.is_orientable],
    [`homology_generators`][triwarp.homology.homology_generators] and anything whose behaviour
    should not depend on the scale of its input.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kind
        Which surface to build:

        - non-orientable and closed — ``"boy"`` and ``"cross_cap"`` (the two immersions of the real
          projective plane, both with Euler characteristic 1), ``"figure8_klein"`` (the Klein
          bottle) and ``"roman"`` (Steiner's surface, with three double lines).
        - non-orientable with a boundary — ``"mobius"`` and ``"henneberg"``.
        - closed of genus 1 — ``"bohemian_dome"``, and see
          [`super_toroid`][triwarp.creation.super_toroid].
        - open, with two boundary loops — ``"klein"`` (which is *not* a Klein bottle as VTK
          parameterizes it: it is orientable and has a boundary), ``"plucker_conoid"`` and
          ``"pseudosphere"``.
        - open, with one boundary loop — ``"bour"``, ``"catalan_minimal"``, ``"conic_spiral"``,
          ``"dini"``, ``"enneper"`` and ``"kuen"``. ``"dini"`` and ``"enneper"`` are the strongly
          graded ones.
    u_resolution, v_resolution
        Number of samples along each parameter direction, including both ends of the domain. At
        least 2.
    device
        Warp device for the result. Defaults to the current device.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[wp.array[wp.vec3], wp.array[wp.int32]]
        ``(vertices, faces)`` on ``device``. The vertex count is below
        ``u_resolution * v_resolution`` wherever the surface glues, and the face count is
        ``2 * (u_resolution - 1) * (v_resolution - 1)`` less one triangle per pole-adjacent cell.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``kind`` is not one of the listed names, or either resolution is below 2 — or below
        3 along an axis the surface wraps without a twist, where a resolution of 2 would identify
        every cell's two rows and leave no faces at all.

    Notes
    -----
    Ported from VTK's ``vtkParametric*`` classes, which pyvista exposes as ``pv.Parametric*``; the
    maps are evaluated in VTK's own frame, so the two agree pointwise to float32.

    The identification along a seam or at a pole is **combinatorial** — it is a fact about the map,
    applied to the index buffer — where VTK welds its raw lattice by distance afterwards. Two
    consequences worth knowing. The topology here is exact and identical at every resolution and on
    every device, and it does not depend on
    [`remove_duplicated_vertices`][triwarp.repair.remove_duplicated_vertices], which several of
    these surfaces exist to test. And where an immersed surface merely *crosses* itself, the sheets
    stay separate: on Catalan's minimal surface VTK merges 40 lattice points that the
    parameterization does not identify, and drops the 2 triangles that thereby became degenerate.

        Squareness exponent of the ring.

    Create a smooth random height field over the square ``[-10, 10] ** 2``.

    A sum of ``n_hills`` Gaussian bumps at seeded random centres, sampled on a regular lattice: an
    open patch with one boundary loop, everywhere smooth, and with curvature that varies across it.
    That makes it the module's input for smoothing, curvature and remeshing, where the Platonic
    solids and the surfaces of revolution are too uniform to distinguish two implementations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_hills
        Number of Gaussian bumps summed into the height.
    amplitude
        Height of a single isolated bump. Overlapping bumps add.
    x_variance, y_variance
        Variances of each bump along X and Y, in the units of the ``[-10, 10]`` domain.
    seed
        RNG seed for the bump centres. A random one is drawn when omitted.
    u_resolution, v_resolution
        Number of samples along X and Y, including both ends of the domain. At least 2.

    -------

    Notes

    Named for VTK's ``vtkParametricRandomHills``, and it is the same idea over the same domain, but
