"""
Sparse voxel grids: voxelize a mesh or a cloud, test membership, reshape, and mesh the result.

The grid is a ``warp.Volume`` -- a NanoVDB *index* grid -- rather than a triwarp value type, and
every function here either produces one or consumes one. Four measured properties are what make
that the right centre, and they are worth knowing before reading anything else:

- **The builder is the dedup.** ``Volume.allocate_by_voxels`` collapses repeated cells as it builds,
  2.3x faster than a sort-and-unique over the same rows on *both* devices, so no function here ever
  calls [`triwarp.grouping.unique_rows`][triwarp.grouping.unique_rows].
- **The volume's linear index is the row index of its cell array.** ``wp.volume_lookup_index``
  returns exactly the row [`cells`][triwarp.voxels.cells] puts that voxel in, so a per-voxel payload
  is a plain ``wp.array`` of length ``n_voxels`` and membership costs one ``O(1)`` probe.
- **NanoVDB centres voxels on integers**, so the volume's translation is ``origin + 0.5 * s`` where
  ``origin`` is the world position of the lower corner of cell ``(0, 0, 0)``. Under that shift cell
  ``c`` covers world ``[origin + c * s, origin + (c + 1) * s)`` exactly, which is Open3D's cell and
  the anchor [`triwarp.remesh.cluster_decimate`][triwarp.remesh.cluster_decimate] already uses.
  [`grid_transform`][triwarp.voxels.grid_transform] undoes the shift so callers never see it.
- **The cell order is leaf-major, not lexicographic**: ``get_voxels`` walks NanoVDB's 8-cubed leaves
  and the cells within each. It is deterministic and identical on CPU and CUDA, but it is *not* a
  C-order ``reshape``, so [`cells`][triwarp.voxels.cells] carries an ``order`` flag for callers who
  need the ascending-key order [`triwarp.grouping.unique_rows`][triwarp.grouping.unique_rows]
  produces.

Because the grid *is* a ``warp.Volume``, a caller can sample it (``wp.volume_sample_f``), probe it
(``wp.volume_lookup_index``) inside their own kernels, save it with ``grid.save_to_nvdb(path)``, and
hand it straight to ``warp.fem``'s nanogrid geometries. There is deliberately no ``to_volume`` pair.

**Three functions here are about a *dense corner lattice* rather than the sparse grid**, and share
nothing with it but the ``(lower, upper)`` ``bounds`` convention
[`triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes`][triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes] takes:
[`grid_points`][triwarp.voxels.grid_points] produces the sample positions,
[`splat_onto_grid`][triwarp.voxels.splat_onto_grid] accumulates a scattered field onto them and
[`sample_grid_trilinear`][triwarp.voxels.sample_grid_trilinear] reads one back. The last two are
transposes of each other and are kept **together**: they share the world-to-lattice map, and
splitting the pair across modules -- the gather reads like one of
[`triwarp.interpolation`][triwarp.interpolation]'s transfer verbs -- would put that map behind a
private import and let the two halves drift a half-cell apart. Section 11's "one operation family,
one module" is what decided it, and
[`interpolate_from_points`][triwarp.interpolation.interpolate_from_points] carries the
cross-reference from the other side.

!!! note "Recipes this module does not wrap"
    - **Implicit CSG**: [`grid_points`][triwarp.voxels.grid_points] →
      [`triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_on_mesh`][triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_on_mesh] per
      solid → ``wp.map(wp.min, ...)`` for a union →
      [`triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes`][triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes]. Wrapping it would put a
      four-module pipeline behind one name and duplicate ``marching_cubes``'s own arguments; the
      *voxel* answer to the same question is [`union`][triwarp.voxels.union] and its two siblings.
    - **A full dense box**: ``from_dense(wp.full(shape, True), s, o)``, which is Open3D's
      ``VoxelGrid.create_dense``. Two calls with no gotcha between them, and a wrapper would
      allocate the identical dense lattice.

    The set algebra, morphological closing and opening, and resampling that this note used to list
    *are* wrapped now -- [`union`][triwarp.voxels.union],
    [`intersection`][triwarp.voxels.intersection], [`difference`][triwarp.voxels.difference],
    [`closing`][triwarp.voxels.closing], [`opening`][triwarp.voxels.opening] and
    [`revoxelize`][triwarp.voxels.revoxelize]. Two of those recipes were wrong as written, which is
    the argument against a recipe nothing runs:
    [`triwarp.array.concatenate`][triwarp.array.concatenate] is rank-1 only and raises on a cell
    array, and a boolean mask is not a Warp gather index.

Notes
-----
An 8-cubed NanoVDB leaf carries a 64-byte occupancy mask, so a set with one voxel per leaf costs
more than the ``(n, 3)`` ``int32`` cell array would. [`cells`][triwarp.voxels.cells] is 0.03 ms per
million voxels, so that array form is always one call away.

The grid build is the module's floor and it is where the data-structure choice was decided: on one
million random cells over a 128-cubed box collapsing to 794 875 voxels, ``allocate_by_voxels``
medians **0.64 ms on CUDA and 138 ms on CPU** against **1.51 ms / 316 ms** for the equivalent
[`triwarp.grouping.unique_rows`][triwarp.grouping.unique_rows] dedup -- 2.3x on both devices, which
is why there is no per-device path here.

Measured medians on ``bunny`` (35 947 vertices, RTX 5090, cells at ``diagonal / 96`` unless noted),
against the reference each function is tested for:

| function | triwarp | reference |
|---|---|---|
| ``voxelize_mesh`` at ``diagonal / 64`` | 0.63 ms | 19.3 ms (open3d) |
| ``voxelize_mesh`` at ``diagonal / 256`` | 0.67 ms | 61.1 ms (open3d) |
| ``voxelize_points`` | 0.55 ms | 2.29 ms (open3d) |
| ``voxel_down_sample`` | 0.80 ms | 1.34 ms (open3d) |
| ``occupancy_at_points``, 10^6 queries | 0.083 ms | 44.0 ms (open3d) |
| ``dilate`` | 0.41 ms | 1.77 ms (trimesh / ndimage) |
| ``fill_cavities`` | 0.74 ms | 5.32 ms (trimesh / ndimage) |
| ``fill_orthographic`` | 1.13 ms | 4.73 ms (trimesh) |
| ``to_boxes`` | 1.01 ms | 23.8 ms (trimesh ``multibox``) |
| ``voxel_corners`` | 0.67 ms | 4.83 ms (igl) |
| ``grid_points`` at 64-cubed | 0.053 ms | 1.62 ms (igl) |

The one place the grid build is *not* the cheap part is [`dilate`][triwarp.voxels.dilate], where it
is **68 %** of the call (0.67 of 0.99 ms at 179 k voxels, against 3 % for the candidate kernel). A
1.16 rebuildable volume was measured as the obvious fix and **rejected**: ``Volume.rebuild`` into a
pre-reserved topology is only 5-7 % faster than a fresh ``allocate_by_voxels`` (0.344 against 0.369
ms at 179 k voxels, 0.836 against 0.885 at 262 k), because the cost is inserting the points and
building the leaves, not the allocation. Two traps found while measuring that, in case it is
retried: the four ``max_*`` capacities **cascade** (``max_leaf_nodes`` defaults to
``max_active_voxels`` and so on down), so supplying only ``max_active_voxels`` at 800 k voxels asks
for 800 k *upper* nodes and dies of out-of-memory -- reported as ``Failed to create volume``, after
which the CUDA context raises illegal-memory-access on everything; and a rebuildable grid reports
its **capacity** through ``get_voxel_count``, which is why [`cells`][triwarp.voxels.cells] never
uses it.

    Occupancy grid of a triangle mesh, by an exact triangle-box overlap test per candidate cell.

    A cell is occupied when the closed triangle actually meets the closed cell, decided by the
    13-axis separating-axis test (three box normals, the triangle plane, nine edge cross-products).
    No sampling, no subdivision heuristic, no tolerance: the accept set is the same one Open3D's
    ``CreateFromTriangleMesh`` produces, and it is what makes ``mode="solid"`` sound.

    The work is flattened into one thread per **(triangle, candidate cell)** pair rather than one
    per triangle, because per-triangle window sizes span orders of magnitude on any real mesh and a
    thread-per-triangle launch is load-imbalanced by that same factor. Each triangle's window is its
    exact inclusive AABB span, whose sizes are prefix-summed into the work-item offsets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer.
    voxel_size
        Cell width. Defaults to ``1 %`` of the bounding-box diagonal, a ~100-cell grid across the
        mesh. **Cost is cubic in the reciprocal.**
    origin
        World position of the lower corner of cell ``(0, 0, 0)``. Defaults to
        ``aabb(vertices).min - 0.5 * voxel_size``, Open3D's half-voxel pad.
    mode
        ``"surface"`` (default) keeps only the cells the surface passes through. ``"solid"`` fills
        the enclosed interior afterwards with [`fill_cavities`][triwarp.voxels.fill_cavities], which
        is correct for a closed input: an exact tri-box voxelization of a closed surface is
        **6-connected sealed**, so no face-adjacent path leaves the interior and the fill needs no
        containment query at all. On an open surface it fills whatever the shell happens to enclose.
    max_candidates
        Guard on the total number of (triangle, cell) pairs, which grows cubically as
        ``voxel_size`` shrinks. Exceeding it raises rather than attempting the allocation.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.Volume
        A NanoVDB index grid on ``vertices.device`` with one active voxel per occupied cell. Empty
        (zero active voxels) when the mesh has no faces.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``voxel_size`` is not positive, if ``mode`` is not one of the two names, if
        ``max_candidates`` is not positive, or if the candidate count exceeds ``max_candidates``.

    Notes
    -----
    Open3D runs the same test in ``float64`` and this one runs in ``float32``, so a triangle exactly
    tangent to a cell plane can be resolved differently by the two. Nothing else differs: Open3D's
    ``round((max - min) / voxel_size) + 2`` candidate window is a superset of the exact AABB window
    used here, and a cell outside a triangle's AABB cannot overlap the triangle.

    trimesh's ``voxelize_subdivide`` is a *different* algorithm -- subdivide until every edge is
    under half a pitch, then round each vertex to a cell -- and its result neither contains nor is
    contained in this one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid
        Index grid to read.
    order
        Row order of the result:

        - ``"grid"`` (default) — the volume's own leaf-major order, free because it is what the
          volume already holds. Deterministic, and identical on CPU and CUDA.
        - ``"sorted"`` — ascending in the packed cell key, which costs one radix sort over the voxel
          count. Column 0 is the key's *least* significant digit, so this is lexicographic with
          ``x`` as the last tiebreak — chosen that way because it is then bit-identical to
          [`triwarp.grouping.unique_rows`][triwarp.grouping.unique_rows]'s order, which is what
          callers comparing against the pre-volume code path need.

    Returns
    -------
    Array2dInt32
        ``(n_voxels, 3)`` cell coordinates on the grid's device. Coordinates may be negative.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError

    Accumulate a scattered field onto a dense lattice with trilinear weights, and average it.

    pytorch3d's ``add_points_features_to_volume_densities_features``, and the scatter half of the
    lattice pair: each point contributes to the **eight** lattice corners around it, weighted by
    the trilinear fractions, and the same eight weights accumulate into a *density* lattice whose
    entry is the number of points that corner saw. The field is then divided by that density, so
    the result is a weighted **mean** rather than a sum and is independent of how many points
    happened to land in a cell.

    This is a **corner lattice** addressed by ``bounds``, the same convention
    [`grid_points`][triwarp.voxels.grid_points] and
    [`triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes`][triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes] take -- not a

    all speak ``bounds``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points
        ``(n_points,)`` positions.
    values
        Length-``n_points`` field on those points, ``wp.float32`` or ``wp.vec3``.
    shape
        ``(nx, ny, nz)`` lattice size, each at least 1.
    bounds
        ``(lower, upper)`` world corners the lattice spans, so corner ``(0, 0, 0)`` sits at
        ``lower`` and ``(nx-1, ny-1, nz-1)`` at ``upper``. ``None`` (the default) is index space:
        the positions are read as lattice coordinates directly.
    min_weight
        Density floor: the division is by ``max(density, min_weight)``, which is what keeps a
        lattice larger than its point cloud finite instead of full of amplified noise. A corner
        nothing reached comes out zero regardless, since its numerator is zero too.

    Returns
    -------
    field : wp.array[DType, Literal[3]]
        ``(nx, ny, nz)`` averaged field on ``points.device``, zero at every corner no point
        reached.
    density : Array3dFloat32
        ``(nx, ny, nz)`` accumulated trilinear weight per corner -- the point count each corner
        saw. Returned rather than discarded because it *is* the occupancy: a corner at zero was
        reached by nothing, and thresholding it is how a caller separates the reconstructed region
        from the empty one.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``shape`` is not three positive integers, if ``points`` and ``values`` differ in length,
        or if ``min_weight`` is not positive.

    [`sample_grid_trilinear`][triwarp.voxels.sample_grid_trilinear]

    [`grid_points`][triwarp.voxels.grid_points]
        The positions of the lattice this writes into.
    [`pool_by_voxel`][triwarp.voxels.pool_by_voxel]
        The nearest-corner counterpart over a sparse ``wp.Volume``: one cell per point rather than
        eight, and a ``min`` / ``max`` / ``sum`` choice this has no analogue for.
    [`interpolate_from_points`][triwarp.interpolation.interpolate_from_points]
        The gather-side alternative when the target is an arbitrary sample set rather than a
        lattice, and the source weighting should be Gaussian rather than trilinear.

    Notes
    -----
    Departs from pytorch3d in two ways, both forced. It takes ``bounds`` where pytorch3d takes a
    normalized ``[-1, 1]`` local space plus an ``align_corners`` switch, because every dense
    lattice in triwarp is addressed by ``bounds``; and it *returns* the pair where pytorch3d
    accumulates into caller-supplied ``volume_densities`` / ``volume_features`` in place. The
    ``min_weight`` floor is pytorch3d's, default and all.

    **This averages, so it is not the inverse of a sample except on the lattice itself.** Three
    properties hold exactly and are worth knowing before reading a round trip as a check
    (all measured, and asserted in ``tests/test_voxels.py``):

    - ``density.sum()`` is the point count exactly -- the eight weights per point sum to 1.
    - Points *on* the lattice corners give ``density == 1`` everywhere and a
      splat-then-sample round trip of **0.0** on any field, because each point's stencil
      degenerates to its own corner.
    - A **constant** field comes back as that constant, to 7.2e-07 on every corner some point
      reached. Off the lattice the round trip is a smoothing rather than the identity -- measured
      5.6e-05 on a random cloud filling 504 of 512 corners, and the residual is the eight
      *unreached* corners, not the weights: a query whose stencil touches one averages a zero in.

    Read a dense lattice at arbitrary positions by trilinear interpolation.

    eight surrounding corners weighted by the same trilinear fractions the splat distributes with.

    points; use [`interpolate_from_points`][triwarp.interpolation.interpolate_from_points] instead
    when the source is a scattered cloud rather than a lattice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    field
        ``(nx, ny, nz)`` lattice, ``wp.float32`` or ``wp.vec3``.
    points
        ``(n_points,)`` positions to sample at.
    bounds
        ``(lower, upper)`` world corners the lattice spans, the same convention
        [`grid_points`][triwarp.voxels.grid_points] and
        [`triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes`][triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes] take. ``None`` (the

    Resample the occupied set onto a lattice of a different cell width.

    trimesh's ``VoxelGrid.revoxelized``, which asks the same question the same way: a cell of the

    is what makes the operation exact at an unchanged ``voxel_size`` and safe when refining, where
    voxelizing the old cell *centres* would instead leave holes between them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid
        Index grid to resample.
    voxel_size
        Cell width of the result. Smaller refines, larger coarsens.
    origin
        World position of the lower corner of the new cell ``(0, 0, 0)``. Defaults to ``grid``'s
        own origin, which is what makes a resample at an unchanged ``voxel_size`` land on the
        *identical* lattice -- same cells, same numbering -- so the result composes with
        [`union`][triwarp.voxels.union] and its siblings.
    max_cells
        Budget for the sampling lattice, which covers the occupied box and therefore grows as the
        cube of ``1 / voxel_size``. Exceeding it raises rather than allocating.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.Volume

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``voxel_size`` or ``max_cells`` is not positive, or the new lattice would exceed

    [`union`][triwarp.voxels.union]
        Set algebra, which needs both grids on one lattice -- this is how one gets there.

    Notes
    -----
    Coarsening by centre sampling drops an old voxel whose cell contains no new centre, so it is
    not the same as "any overlap": at ``2 * voxel_size`` a lone voxel survives only if a new centre
    lands inside it. Take [`dilate`][triwarp.voxels.dilate] first when the result must contain the
    input.

    Only the occupied box is sampled, not the whole box between ``origin`` and the set, so a grid
    whose voxels sit far from its own origin costs no more than a tight one. That is what the
    ``origin_cell`` half of [`from_dense`][triwarp.voxels.from_dense] is for.

    An **even integer** coarsening is the one ill-conditioned case: it places every new centre
    exactly on a face of the old lattice, at ``origin + (2c + 1) * old_size``, so which of the two
    neighbouring cells answers is decided by float32 rounding. Pass an ``origin`` displaced by a
    fraction of a cell where that matters; odd and fractional factors sample strictly inside an old
    cell and are exact.

    Grow the voxel set by one shell of neighbours per iteration.

    trimesh's ``morphology.binary_dilation`` (``scipy.ndimage.binary_dilation``). Every voxel writes
    its whole neighbourhood as candidate cells and the builder dedups them, so there is no unique
    pass — but the candidate buffer is ``(connectivity + 1) * n_voxels`` cells, which is
    **324 MB at a million voxels and ``connectivity=26``**. That bound is why 6 is the default.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid
        Index grid to dilate.
    connectivity
        Neighbourhood: ``6`` face-adjacent (the default, and
        ``scipy.ndimage.generate_binary_structure(3, 1)``), ``18`` face and edge, ``26`` the full

    iterations
        Number of dilation passes. Each is a separate grid build; a widened stencil is deliberately
        not used, since a ``(2r+1)``-cubed structure is strictly more candidate work.

    Notes
    -----
    With ``cull_internal=True`` on a solid set the result is closed and manifold; with ``False`` it
    is not, since interior faces are duplicated back to back.

    The corner lattice is shared rather than duplicated, so culling the interior faces leaves the
    interior *corners* unreferenced -- they belong to the lattice but to no surviving face. Those
    are compacted away before returning, which is a change worth knowing about if a caller was
    relying on an index into the full lattice: it was not, since the lattice itself is
    [`voxel_corners`][triwarp.voxels.voxel_corners] and that is where an index into it comes from.

    The compaction is measured and it pays for itself twice over. On a solid ``icosphere(4)`` at
    three voxel sizes on CUDA it drops **81-96 %** of the vertex buffer -- 41 624 to 8 072 corners
    at 37 k voxels, and 4 370 680 to **190 640** at 4.3 M (52 MB of ``wp.vec3`` down to 2.3 MB) --
    for 1.27x / 1.09x / **1.01x** of the call. A share that falls as the input grows, on a saving

    Build the deduplicated corner lattice of the voxel set, plus each voxel's eight corners.

    ``igl.unique_sparse_voxel_corners``. The lattice is not computed here: ``warp.fem``'s sparse
    nanogrid geometry derives its own vertex grid from the cell grid, and that grid *is* the
    deduplicated corner set — so this is eight ``O(1)`` probes per voxel and no ``8 * n_voxels``
    candidate buffer, no unique pass, and no hand-built dual grid.

    Corner ``(i, j, k)`` is the **lower** corner of cell ``(i, j, k)``, at world position
    ``origin + (i, j, k) * voxel_size``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid
        Index grid to read.

    Returns
    -------
    corners : Array2dInt32
        ``(n_corners, 3)`` corner coordinates, in the corner grid's own leaf-major order.
    cell_corners : Array2dInt32
        ``(n_voxels, 8)`` indices into ``corners``, one row per voxel of
        [`cells`][triwarp.voxels.cells], ordered by binary counting on ``(dx, dy, dz)`` with ``dx``
        the most significant bit.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If ``grid`` is not a NanoVDB index grid with isotropic voxels.

    See Also
    --------

    -----
    igl numbers a cell's corners in ``yxz`` binary-counting order, a fixed permutation of the order
    used here.
