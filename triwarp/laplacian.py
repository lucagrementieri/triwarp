"""
Discrete Laplacians on a triangle mesh, and the intrinsic repairs that keep them well-behaved.

Every Laplacian this package builds lives here: the cotangent (stiffness) operator and its
vector-valued sibling, the combinatorial and row-normalized 1-ring operators, and the lumped mass
matrix that pairs with them.

The cotangent operator needs only *edge lengths*, not vertex positions — which is what makes it
repairable without moving anything. A sliver triangle produces a huge cotangent weight and solves
that are ill-conditioned; a *degenerate* one, whose three edge lengths fail the triangle inequality
outright (common after ``float32`` rounding, decimation, or a boolean), has no finite weight at all.
The assembly refuses to divide by such a face's zero area, so it contributes nothing — the operator
stays finite, but that face's edge couplings are simply **missing** from it, which is a wrong
operator rather than an unusable one.

[`mollify_intrinsic`][triwarp.laplacian.mollify_intrinsic] (Sharp & Crane 2020) fixes both by adding
one global constant to every edge length — the smallest that restores the triangle inequality with a
margin. The perturbation is slight and uniform, which beats the alternatives: the operator stays
symmetric, no vertex moves, no connectivity changes, and a mesh that is already fine gets
``delta = 0`` and is untouched. Mollification makes the weights *finite*;
[`intrinsic_delaunay`][triwarp.remesh.intrinsic_delaunay] (in
[`triwarp.remesh`][triwarp.remesh], beside the extrinsic flipper) makes them *non-negative*.
[`robust_laplacian`][triwarp.laplacian.robust_laplacian] combines them.

The **higher-order** operators assembled *from* these -- the integrated k-harmonic form, the two
Hessian smoothness energies, the edge-based Crouzeix-Raviart pair and the LSCM Hessian -- live one
module along in [`triwarp.energies`][triwarp.energies]. The line is first order against second: this
module builds the operators, that one builds the quadratic forms a solver minimizes. A reader
arriving from libigl, where ``cotmatrix`` and ``crouzeix_raviart_cotmatrix`` sit together, wants
[`crouzeix_raviart_cotmatrix`][triwarp.energies.crouzeix_raviart_cotmatrix].

    Gradient of a per-vertex scalar field inside each face, as a vector in that face's plane.

    The piecewise-linear gradient is constant per triangle:
    ``grad = 1/(2A) * sum_k values[k] * (n x e_k)``, with ``e_k`` the counter-clockwise edge
    opposite corner ``k``. It satisfies ``dot(grad, e) == values[end] - values[start]`` for every
    edge of the face, which is the property that makes it the discrete gradient rather than a finite
    difference.

    Accumulated in ``float64`` and returned as ``wp.vec3d``: the fields this serves decay
    exponentially (diffused heat, geodesic distance), and a ``float32`` sum of the three cross
    products loses the far field. A degenerate face gets the zero vector rather than a division by
    its zero area.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer.
    values

    face_normals, face_areas
        Optional precomputed per-face unit normals and areas, as returned by
        [`face_normals_and_areas`][triwarp.triangles.face_normals_and_areas]. Recomputed when
        either is ``None``.

    Returns

    Notes
    -----
    ``igl.grad(V, F)`` is the same operator in *matrix* form, a sparse ``(3 * n_faces, n_vertices)``
    map whose product with the field stacks the gradients as ``[all x; all y; all z]``. triwarp
    returns the applied result instead of the matrix, because that is what every in-repo consumer
    wants -- the heat method takes the normalized gradient face by face and never needs the operator
    itself. ``tests/test_laplacian.py`` compares the two through that product.

    Cotangent Laplacian that a bad triangulation cannot poison, via mollification and flips.

    Two independent repairs, both intrinsic — no vertex moves, so the surface is unchanged:

    * **mollification** adds one constant to every edge length so that no triangle is degenerate,
      which is what keeps the weights finite at all
      ([`mollify_intrinsic`][triwarp.laplacian.mollify_intrinsic]);
    * **intrinsic Delaunay flips** retriangulate toward non-negative cotangent weights, which is
      what makes the operator satisfy a maximum principle
      ([`intrinsic_delaunay`][triwarp.remesh.intrinsic_delaunay]). Not *until* — that function
      keeps a simplicial output, so it declines a flip whose new edge already joins the same two
      vertices, and a strongly graded surface can leave a handful of negative weights behind that
      no number of rounds removes. See its Notes; check the result rather than assuming it.

    ``potpourri3d``'s ``use_robust=True`` solvers build. Turn the flips off for a drop-in
    [`cotmatrix`][triwarp.laplacian.cotmatrix] that keeps every edge coupling: the plain operator
    drops the ones belonging to a degenerate face, because a zero-area triangle has no finite
    cotangent to contribute.

    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.

        flattening — angles are measured from each vertex's first outgoing halfedge, the same
        convention [`vertex_tangent_frames`][triwarp.tangent_space.vertex_tangent_frames] uses to
        pick ``basis_x`` — so a caller-supplied frame cannot change these angles, and solutions are
        already consistent with the frames that convention produces.

    Per-edge weight triplets for the 1-ring Laplacian, before assembly.

    The analogue of [`cotmatrix_entries`][triwarp.laplacian.cotmatrix_entries] for the umbrella
    operator, assembled and row-normalized by [`laplacian`][triwarp.laplacian.laplacian].

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    equal_weight
        If ``True`` every edge weight is ``1`` (uniform umbrella weights). If ``False`` the
        weight is inverse edge length ``1 / (‖vi - vj‖ + 1e-12)``.
    symmetric
        Adjacency shape. If ``False`` one triplet per directed triangle edge is emitted (trimesh's
        ``mesh.edges``); on meshes with a boundary this is asymmetric. If ``True`` each unique
        undirected edge emits both directed pairs (trimesh's ``vertex_neighbors``), giving a
        symmetric adjacency. When ``None`` (default) the trimesh convention is used:
        ``symmetric = not equal_weight``.
    dtype
        Scalar type of the returned ``vals``: ``wp.float32`` (default) or ``wp.float64``. The
        assembly kernel casts the float32 edge weights to ``dtype`` so the matrix built from these
        triplets is native float32/float64.
    edges
        Optional precomputed ``(m, 2)`` unique undirected edges from
        [`edges_unique`][triwarp.edges.edges_unique], used only by the ``symmetric`` branch --
        which is the ``equal_weight=False`` default, so this is the keyword that matters for the
        geometry-weighted operator. When ``None`` the edge set is derived here.

        Worth passing whenever the caller already holds it, because deriving the edge set can
        dominate the whole call on a large mesh. Ignored by the directed branch, which reads
        ``faces`` alone.

        Trusted to already be **unique and undirected**, the way ``edges_unique`` guarantees --
        that invariant is not, and cannot cheaply be, checked (verifying it would mean redoing the
        sort-and-deduplicate pass this argument exists to let a caller skip). A duplicated or
        non-deduplicated array silently doubles or miscounts the affected edges' weights rather
        than raising. ``validate`` below only guards the cheaper, memory-unsafe half of this
        precondition (an out-of-range vertex index), not this one.
    validate
        When ``True`` (default) and a caller-supplied ``edges`` is used (the ``symmetric`` branch
        with ``edges`` not ``None``), check that every index in it falls inside
        ``[0, n_vertices)`` before launching -- a stale ``edges`` array (e.g. from before a
        decimation pass changed the vertex count) otherwise drives the triplet kernel to read
        ``vertices`` out of bounds with no exception (§12.1's memory-safety class). Pass ``False``
        only when ``edges`` is known correct by construction, as this module's own
        [`laplacian`][triwarp.laplacian.laplacian] does when it just derived ``edges`` itself.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of wp.array
        ``(rows, cols, vals)`` on ``faces.device``. Length ``3 * n_faces`` for the directed case,
        ``2 * n_unique_edges`` for the symmetric case.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices``, ``faces`` and ``edges`` are not all on one device.
    ValueError
        If ``validate`` and a caller-supplied ``edges`` references a vertex index outside

    positions replaces each vertex by the weighted mean of its 1-ring, matching

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    equal_weight
        If ``True`` all neighbors are weighted equally (``1 / degree``). If ``False`` neighbors
        are weighted by inverse edge length before normalization.
    symmetric
        Adjacency shape (see [`laplacian_entries`][triwarp.laplacian.laplacian_entries]). If
        ``False`` the directed ``mesh.edges`` adjacency is used (asymmetric on boundaries); if
        ``True`` the symmetric ``vertex_neighbors`` adjacency is used. When ``None`` (default)

        [`trimesh.smoothing.laplacian_calculation`][] for both weightings. The two choices differ
        only on meshes with an open boundary.
    dtype
        Scalar block type of the assembled matrix: ``wp.float32`` (default) or ``wp.float64``. Use
        ``wp.float64`` when the operator feeds a linear-system solve; the matrix is built and
        row-normalized natively in the requested precision (single ``bsr_from_triplets``).
    edges
        Optional precomputed ``(m, 2)`` unique undirected edges, forwarded to
        [`laplacian_entries`][triwarp.laplacian.laplacian_entries]. Read its note before skipping
        this: on the ``symmetric`` branch (the ``equal_weight=False`` default) deriving the edge
        set can dominate the call, so a caller that already holds one -- or that assembles the
        operator repeatedly over fixed connectivity, as
        [`filter_taubin`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_taubin] does at ``recompute=True`` -- should
        pass it. Ignored when the adjacency is directed.
    validate
        Forwarded to [`laplacian_entries`][triwarp.laplacian.laplacian_entries]: when ``True``
        (default) and ``edges`` is given, check its indices fall in ``[0, n_vertices)`` before
        launching. Pass ``False`` only when ``edges`` is known correct by construction (e.g.
        derived once outside a loop over fixed connectivity, as
        [`filter_taubin`][triwarp.smoothing.filter_taubin] does).
