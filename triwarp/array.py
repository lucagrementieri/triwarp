def arange(

) -> wp.array[wp.int32]:
    """
    Evenly spaced integers over the half-open interval ``[start, stop)`` (``numpy.arange``).

    Called with a varying number of positional arguments, exactly as [`numpy.arange`][]:
    ``arange(stop, device=...)`` runs from ``0``, ``arange(start, stop, device=...)`` from
    ``start``, and ``arange(start, stop, step, device=...)`` spaces the values by ``step``. A
    ``step`` may be negative, in which case the interval runs downwards.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start
        Start of the interval, included. Read as ``stop`` when ``stop`` is omitted, in which case
        the interval starts at ``0``.
    stop
        End of the interval, excluded.
    step
        Spacing between consecutive values, so ``out[i + 1] - out[i] == step``. Must be non-zero.
    device
        Warp device for the result. Keyword-only, unlike the first three, so the positional
        arguments stay [`numpy.arange`][]'s; required, because nothing in this package allocates
        onto Warp's ambient current device.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.int32]
        1-D array of ``max(0, ceil((stop - start) / step))`` values on ``device``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``step`` is zero, or the first or last value does not fit in ``int32``.

    Notes
    -----
    There is no ``dtype`` argument, which is the one place this departs from [`numpy.arange`][]'s
    signature. Every index buffer in this package is ``int32``, so a second width has no caller,
    and registering the kernel overloads for widths nothing reaches would cost compile time on
    every rebuild. The range check above is what stands in for choosing a wider dtype: a range
    that does not fit raises rather than silently wrapping.

    --------

    """
    Concatenate several 1-D ``warp.array`` instances into one buffer plus per-segment offsets.

    Segment ``i`` starts at ``offsets[i]`` in ``flat``; its length is ``arrays[i].size``, so it
    occupies ``flat[offsets[i] : offsets[i] + arrays[i].size]``. This is the usual packed
    representation for variable-length per-item lists on the device (no nested arrays).

    !!! note "The packed pair is spelled values first, offsets second"
        This function is where the package's convention is stated, because it is the primitive the
        others are built on: **a packed buffer and its offsets are returned, and accepted, values
        first.** Fifteen public functions hand back such a pair —
        [`boundary_loops_batched`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops_batched],
        [`successor_cycles`][triwarp.graph.successor_cycles],
        [`query_ball_with_offsets`][triwarp.neighbors.query_ball_with_offsets],
        [`geodesic_ball`][triwarp.neighbors.geodesic_ball],
        [`vertex_face_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.vertex_face_adjacency],
        [`vertex_one_rings`][triwarp.halfedge.vertex_one_rings] and the
        [`triwarp.geodesic_walk`][triwarp.geodesic_walk] tracers among them — and every function
        that *takes* one ([`split`][triwarp.array.split],
        [`trace_polylines`][triwarp.geodesic_walk.trace_polylines],
        [`submeshes_from_face_groups`][triwarp.selection.submeshes_from_face_groups]) takes it in
        the same order. Both halves are ``wp.int32`` in the common case, so a transposed unpack
        type-checks, runs, and indexes garbage; there is nothing but the convention to lean on.
        Where a third array rides along it is a *per-item* one and goes last, as in
        ``(ring_halfedges, offsets, is_boundary)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arrays
        Non-empty sequence of 1-D arrays sharing the same ``dtype`` and ``device``.
    copy
        Keep ``False`` for a read-only result. ``arrays`` that are already consecutive non-empty
        views of one buffer -- what [`split`][triwarp.array.split] returns with ``copy=False`` --
        are then handed back as that buffer's span instead of being copied into a new one, so the
        ``split`` round trip costs nothing at all. The default copies, so writing into ``flat`` is
        safe; with ``copy=False`` such a write reaches the segments.

    Returns
    -------
    flat
        1-D array of length ``sum(a.size for a in arrays)``, same ``dtype`` and ``device`` as
        the inputs.
    offsets
        Length ``len(arrays)`` (the start offset of each segment, an exclusive scan of the
        segment sizes), ``dtype`` ``wp.int32``, same ``device`` as the inputs. ``offsets[0] == 0``.
        This is *not* a total-terminated CSR array — there is no ``offsets[-1] == flat.size``
        terminator, so the last segment's length must be taken from ``arrays[-1].size`` (or
        ``flat.size - offsets[-1]``).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``arrays`` is empty, any input is not rank-1, or their ``dtype`` differs.

    Return the span these segments already occupy, when they are consecutive views of one buffer.

    ``split`` and [`pack_1d_arrays`][triwarp.array.pack_1d_arrays] are documented inverses, and the
    round trip is common: [`boundary_loops`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops] slices one packed
    buffer into per-loop views and every batched consumer of those loops packs them straight back.
    Copying there would rebuild a buffer that already exists, one ``wp.copy`` per segment to move
    data that never needs to move.

    It runs only for a caller that asked (``copy=False``), because a packer that *sometimes* aliases
    is a trap: ``combine.concatenate`` adds each piece's vertex offset into the packed face buffer
    **in place**, so a view handed to it rewrites the caller's own faces. Which callers write is not
    inferable from here, so the choice stays theirs.

    The gate is *identity* on the base rather than adjacency of the pointers. Two separately
    allocated buffers can land adjacent in Warp's memory pool by luck, and an adjacency test would
    then alias or copy depending on the allocator. Requiring a common base restricts the fast path
    to callers already holding aliases of one allocation -- exactly the ``split`` round trip.

    ``_ref`` is Warp's own back-reference from a slice to the array it keeps alive (Warp 1.17); it
    is read through ``getattr`` and every conclusion drawn from it is re-checked against the public
    ``ptr`` / ``shape`` / ``strides`` / ``dtype`` / ``device``, so a release that drops the
    attribute loses the fast path rather than the correctness. ``None`` when the segments are not
    one buffer's, which is the ordinary case.

    Ascending sort of ``keys`` together with the permutation that produced it.

    Both halves of ``numpy.sort`` and ``numpy.argsort`` at once: a radix sort produces the ordered
    keys as a side effect of computing the order, so returning only one of the two would throw work
    away. ``sorted_keys[i] == keys[order[i]]``.

    Wraps ``warp.utils.radix_sort_pairs``, which needs double-width scratch for both the keys and
    the payload; this allocates that scratch, seeds the payload with ``0..n-1`` and hands back
    length-``n`` views of the sorted prefixes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    keys
        Length-``n`` sort keys (any radix-sortable scalar dtype; see
        [`sortable_dtype`][triwarp.typing.sortable_dtype] for which those are).
    fill_value
        Padding written into the upper half of the payload buffer, where the sort's scratch lives.
        Only matters to callers that read past ``n``.

    Returns
    -------
    sorted_keys : wp.array
        Length-``n`` view of the ascending keys.
    order : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Length-``n`` view of the original index of each sorted key.

    Notes

    Both results are **views** into the scratch buffers, kept alive by the returned arrays. Clone
    them if they must outlive the caller's frame alongside another sort.

    The sort is **stable**: equal keys keep their input order, so ``order`` is ascending within
    each run of duplicate keys. ``warp.utils.radix_sort_pairs`` documents this ("the sort is
    stable and operates in linear time"), it is inherent to its LSD radix passes, and it is
    verified on both devices against ``numpy.argsort(kind="stable")``. Callers may rely on it --

    n_triplets

        sums entries that land on the same position.

        Element type of the value buffer. A scalar (``wp.float32`` / ``wp.float64``) for a
        1x1-block matrix, or a matrix type (``wp.mat22d``) for a block matrix.

    rows, cols, values

    ``wp.empty`` rather than ``wp.zeros`` deliberately: a triplet writer fills all three buffers,

    Test whether each element appears in ``test_elements`` (``numpy.isin`` for integers).

    Works for every Warp integer dtype -- ``int8`` through ``int64``, ``uint8`` through ``uint64``
    -- and for negative values. Both arrays must share one dtype.

    Two strategies, chosen by the value **span** ``max - min + 1`` taken over both inputs together.
    When the span is modest relative to ``len(test_elements)``, membership is a boolean lookup table
    indexed by ``value - min`` (fast for dense mesh indices). Otherwise ``test_elements`` is sorted
    and each query is a binary search, which keeps memory bounded when the values are sparse in
    their dtype.


    Parameters
    ----------
    elements
        Integer array of **any rank** on the target device. Membership is a per-element predicate,
        so the array is flattened, tested, and the result reshaped back; nothing in the two
        strategies looks at the shape.
    test_elements
        1D array of values to test membership against, of the same dtype as ``elements``.
    max_index
        Optional exclusive upper bound on the values of **both** arrays, which must then be
        non-negative -- the same escape hatch, and the same shape of it, as
        [`hash_indices_rows`][triwarp.grouping.hash_indices_rows]' ``max_index``. Supplying it
        pins the strategy to the direct-index table and skips the two ``triwarp.reduce.minmax``
        reductions that would otherwise infer the span, and with them two host readbacks that
        serialise the device pipeline. Must be positive. Pass it wherever the bound is structural,
        as it is for any buffer of mesh vertex indices.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.bool]
        Boolean array with the same shape as ``elements``. All ``False`` when either
        input is empty.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If either array is not an integer dtype, or the two dtypes differ.
    ValueError
        If ``max_index`` is not positive.

    Warnings
    --------
    A ``max_index`` smaller than the true maximum is a wrong answer, not a raise: a value at or
    above it reads as absent, however far above it lies and on either side of the comparison.
    Unlike [`hash_indices_rows`][triwarp.grouping.hash_indices_rows]' bound it is at least
    memory-safe, because the table lookup range-guards each slot.

    --------

    [`sortable_dtype`][triwarp.typing.sortable_dtype]
    [`numpy.isin`][]

    Notes
    -----
    Dtypes narrower than four bytes are widened to ``int32`` / ``uint32`` (the
    [`sortable_dtype`][triwarp.typing.sortable_dtype] rule) before either strategy runs: Warp's
    radix sort does not accept them, and neither does the tiled min/max reduction the span needs.

    There is no ``assume_unique``, and its absence is deliberate rather than an omission:
    [`numpy.isin`][] gains from one because the sort path behind it calls [`numpy.unique`][] on both
    arrays first, and neither strategy here dedups anything -- the table is an idempotent scatter
    and the binary search is over the sorted keys as given, so duplicates on either side are already
    free. What the two strategies *do* pay for is inferring the value span, which is why the
    guarantee this takes is a bound rather than a uniqueness claim.

    Without ``max_index``: two host readbacks, one min/max reduction per input, which is what
    selects the strategy and anchors the table.

    """
    Dense copy of ``src`` gathered along its first axis by ``indices`` (``numpy.take``).

    Warp's ``src[indices]`` fancy indexing yields a ``warp.indexedarray`` view; this
    materializes a contiguous ``warp.array`` (performing the copy) so callers get a real
    array supporting ``.reshape`` and a stable return type. Works for rank-1 sources
    (``src[indices]``) and rank-2 row gather (``src[indices, :]``), with any scalar or vector

    Only the first axis is indexable, which is what every caller in this package needs. To take a
    *column*, materialize it with ``wp.clone(src[:, k])`` — a column view is strided, and Warp's
    fancy indexing silently ignores the stride of an index array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    src
        Rank-1 or rank-2 ``wp.array`` on the target device.
    indices

    ``warp.utils.array_cast`` performs -- the pair this replaces at twenty-odd call sites -- through
    a concrete kernel for the conversions the package reaches most, and through
    ``warp.utils.array_cast`` itself for any other.

    dtype
        Target scalar dtype.

    ValueError
        If ``values`` is rank-2 and not contiguous, since the rank-2 path flattens.

    Notes
    -----
    ``warp.utils.array_cast``'s kernel is ``dest[i] = dest.dtype(src[i])``, which is a *scalar*
    conversion -- handed a rank-2 array it fails to compile, because ``src[i]`` is a row. So rank-2
    input is cast through paired ``flatten()`` views here rather than at each call site, which is
    what several of them were doing by hand.

    The output keeps ``values``' shape, so this is not a reinterpretation that changes rank: an
    ``(n, 3)`` ``float32`` read as ``(n,)`` ``wp.vec3`` is a different operation and still calls
    ``wp.utils.array_cast`` directly, as [`hash_rows`][triwarp.grouping.hash_rows] and

    """
    Exclusive upper bound on an index buffer's values, as ``max(indices) + 1``.

    For a face or edge buffer this is the vertex count, and it follows libigl's
    ``F.maxCoeff() + 1`` convention: one past the largest referenced index, so a mesh with trailing
    unreferenced vertices reports fewer than it has. Accepts any ``wp.int32`` index buffer of any
    shape -- a length-``3 * n_faces`` flat triangle buffer, an ``(n, 2)`` edge array -- and reads
    only the 4-byte maximum back to the host.

    Named for the index buffer rather than for vertices because that is all it sees: it is
    index arithmetic, and nothing about it is geometric. Named a *bound* rather than a size
    because that is what a consumer wants it for -- to allocate a table the indices address, or to
    hand [`hash_indices_rows`][triwarp.grouping.hash_indices_rows] its radix -- and because a mesh
    with trailing unreferenced vertices has more of them than this reports.

    require_non_negative
        Raise if any index is negative. Free: the minimum comes out of the same reduction, the
        same buffer and the same host readback as the maximum, so asking for both costs what
        asking for one does. It exists because the pairing it replaces is not free -- a caller
        that takes this bound and then hands it to
        [`hash_indices_rows`][triwarp.grouping.hash_indices_rows] with ``validate=True`` reduces

    leading zero is already in place, which makes the first ``n`` entries the exclusive sum and the

    Parameters
    ----------
    counts
        Length-``n`` ``wp.int32`` per-element counts.
    include_total

    Returns
    -------
    offsets : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Exclusive prefix sum: length ``n`` by default, or ``n + 1`` with ``offsets[n] == total``

    Two offsets conventions coexist in this package: the length-``n`` form, with the total
    implicit, and the length-``n + 1`` form that stores it (``halfedge.vertex_one_rings``,
    ``geodesic_walk.trace_from_vertex``, and every ``segmented_sort_pairs`` caller). Both come
    out of here, so no caller has to append the terminator afterwards.

    **This is for callers that want ``total``**, which it reads back unconditionally, and a host
    readback serialises the device pipeline. A caller that only needs the offsets and already knows
    its buffer size should keep the open-coded ``wp.zeros(n + 1)`` plus a scan into ``[1:]``, as
    ``halfedge.vertex_one_rings`` and ``adjacency.vertex_face_adjacency`` do: both size their

    Remap an index buffer through a lookup table, passing negative (sentinel) entries through.

    Not a plain [`gather`][triwarp.array.gather]: the ``-1`` slots that mark padded or removed
    entries in an index buffer must survive the remap unchanged, where a gather would read out of
    bounds on them. [`triwarp.repair`][triwarp.repair] relies on this — its functions preserve
    ``-1`` face sentinels through vertex renumbering (see ``remove_unreferenced_vertices``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    indices
        1D ``wp.int32`` array of indices into ``remap`` (e.g. a flat face buffer). Negative
        entries are passed through unchanged.
    remap
        1D ``wp.int32`` lookup table (e.g. old-to-new vertex index map).

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.int32]
        Length ``len(indices)`` array on ``indices.device`` with ``out[i] = remap[indices[i]]``
        for non-negative ``indices[i]``, and ``out[i] = indices[i]`` otherwise.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError

def trim_to_count(

    """
    Trim atomic-append output buffers to the number of elements actually written.

    A kernel that emits an unpredictable number of results cannot size its output ahead of
    time. The usual pattern is to over-allocate the output buffers to a safe upper bound and
    have each thread claim its slots with ``wp.atomic_add`` on a shared length-1 ``counter``,
    writing into ``buffer[slot]``. After the launch, only the first ``n_out`` slots hold valid
    data and the tail is uninitialized, but ``n_out`` is known only on the device.

    This finalizes that pattern: it reads the counter back to the host once, then copies the
    valid prefix ``buffer[:n_out]`` of each over-allocated buffer into a freshly allocated,
    exact-size array. Pass every buffer filled by the same counter in one call so they are all
    trimmed to a consistent length.

    Parameters
    ----------
    counter
        Length-1 ``wp.int32`` array holding the final atomic-append count on the target device.
    *buffers
        Over-allocated output buffers to trim, all indexed along their first axis by the same
        counter. Any rank and ``dtype``; trailing dimensions are preserved.

    Returns
    -------
    n_out : int
        The counter value: the number of valid leading elements in each buffer.
    trimmed : list[wp.array]
        One contiguous ``(n_out, *buffer.shape[1:])`` copy per input buffer, in order, each on

    """
    Reinterpret an array's underlying bits as a same-width signed integer dtype.

    32-bit-or-narrower dtypes (``wp.int32``, ``wp.uint32``, ``wp.float32``, and narrower) are
    reinterpreted as ``wp.int32``; wider dtypes (``wp.int64``, ``wp.uint64``, ``wp.float64``) as
    ``wp.int64``. Narrower-than-32-bit floating point values are first upcast to ``wp.float32``
    (a numeric cast, not a bit reinterpretation) so every dtype narrower than 32 bits shares one
    ``wp.int32`` key space. Used by the hashing/uniqueness machinery
    ([`unique_1d`][triwarp.grouping.unique_1d]) to give arbitrary scalar dtypes a common sortable,
    hashable integer key.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data
        Rank-1 ``wp.array`` of any scalar dtype.
    count
        Output length. Defaults to ``data.shape[0]``. When greater than the input length, the
