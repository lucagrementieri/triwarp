"""
Queries that ask where a point stands relative to a triangle mesh.

Three answers, in increasing order of what they need from the mesh:
[`closest_point_on_mesh`][triwarp.proximity.closest_point_on_mesh] and
[`normals_at_closest_faces`][triwarp.proximity.normals_at_closest_faces] need only a surface;
[`signed_distance_on_mesh`][triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_on_mesh] needs a consistent winding
to give the distance a sign; and [`winding_number`][triwarp.proximity.winding_number] needs neither
watertightness nor manifoldness, which is why it is the robust inside test on damaged input.
[`containing_faces_2d`][triwarp.proximity.containing_faces_2d] is the planar case -- point location
in a 2D triangulation -- and
[`query_mesh_aabb_with_offsets`][triwarp.proximity.query_mesh_aabb_with_offsets] is
the low-level box query the others are built over.

Everything here takes raw ``(vertices, faces)`` buffers. The queries phrased the other way round --
*how far away* the surface is rather than *where* it is, all taking a prebuilt ``wp.Mesh`` and a set
of points to measure at -- live in [`triwarp.visibility`][triwarp.visibility]: ambient occlusion and
obscurance outward, shape diameter and thickness inward, and the maximal tangent sphere in every
direction at once.

Everything signed here, plus [`contains_points`][triwarp.ray.contains_points], follows Warp's SDF
sign convention: outside positive, inside negative. Trimesh's ``signed_distance`` uses the opposite
sign.

Point-set acceleration structures (``wp.Bvh`` / ``wp.HashGrid``) and raw neighbor queries live in
[`triwarp.neighbors`][triwarp.neighbors]; axis-aligned bounding boxes in
[`triwarp.bounds`][triwarp.bounds].

    For each query point, find the closest point on any edge of an edge set.

    The **wireframe** counterpart of
    [`closest_point_on_mesh`][triwarp.proximity.closest_point_on_mesh]: same return triple, same
    ``max_dist`` semantics, but the geometry is a set of segments rather than a surface. That is the
    query a crease set, a seam, a boundary rim or a feature curve wants -- all four are already
    produced as an edge array by [`triwarp.seams`][triwarp.seams],
    [`triwarp.boundary`][triwarp.boundary] and [`triwarp.edges`][triwarp.edges].

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n,)`` positions the edges index, as ``wp.vec3``.
    edges
        ``(n_edges, 2)`` ``wp.int32`` vertex-index pairs. Order within a pair is irrelevant, and
        edges may share vertices or repeat.
    queries
        ``(m,)`` query positions in space as ``wp.vec3``.
    max_dist
        Maximum search distance per query; an edge farther than this is ignored and the query
        reports a miss. When ``None``, derived from the box enclosing ``vertices`` and ``queries``,
        which no real query can exceed.
    bvh
        A ``wp.Bvh`` already built over this edge set's per-edge boxes, to spare the bounds pass and
        the build. Purely an optimization -- and, as with
        [`closest_point_on_mesh`][triwarp.proximity.closest_point_on_mesh]'s ``mesh``, it is not
        checked against ``vertices`` / ``edges``: a BVH over a *different* edge set silently answers
        for the boxes it holds while the distances are computed from these vertices.

    Returns
    -------
    closest
        ``(m,)`` closest point on the edge set for each query, as ``wp.vec3``.
    distance
        ``(m,)`` unsigned distance from each query to that point.
    edge_id
        ``(m,)`` row of ``edges`` the closest point lies on, or ``-1`` when no edge lies within
        ``max_dist``.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If ``edges`` is not a rank-2 ``wp.int32`` array.
    ValueError
        If ``edges`` does not have two columns.
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices``, ``edges``, ``queries`` and ``bvh`` are not all on one device.

    Notes
    -----
    A miss reports the query point itself and ``max_dist``, alongside the ``-1`` id -- the same
    convention [`closest_point_on_mesh`][triwarp.proximity.closest_point_on_mesh] uses, so the two
    are interchangeable in a caller that only reads the id.

    The traversal is iterative deepening over a per-edge-box BVH and is **exact**, not a broad-phase
    approximation: a scan of the cube of half-extent ``r`` about a query enumerates every edge whose
    closest point lies within ``r``, so a best distance under ``r`` certifies the answer. The
    tempting shortcut -- one degenerate ``(a, b, b)`` triangle per edge, queried with
    ``wp.mesh_query_point_no_sign`` -- does **not** work: Warp's mesh BVH rejects a zero-area
    triangle outright, on both devices.

    Smallest distance between two triangle meshes, with the pair of faces that achieves it.

    The clearance between two parts, and zero when they touch or overlap. Unlike a vertex-to-mesh
    query this is the true minimum over the *surfaces*: two boxes edge to edge realise their
    clearance between edge interiors, and every vertex of each is further from the other than
    that.

    Two phases. An upper bound comes first -- the smallest distance from a *sample* of ``A``'s
    vertices to ``B``, which is a real distance between the surfaces and therefore an upper bound on
    their minimum. Then every face of ``A`` queries a BVH over ``B``'s faces with its own bounding
    box grown by that bound, and each candidate pair gets the exact triangle-triangle distance. The
    bound is what makes the broad phase sound rather than heuristic: the true minimum is at most the
    bound, so the pair achieving it has boxes within that distance and cannot be culled -- and that
    argument needs an upper bound rather than a *tight* one, which is why sampling is sound and why
    supplying your own coarse ``upper_bound`` is too. The returned distance is exact either way; a
    looser bound only leaves more candidates for the narrow phase to reject.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices_a, faces_a
        First mesh: ``(n_vertices,)`` positions and a length-``3 * n_faces`` index buffer.
    vertices_b, faces_b
        Second mesh, same layout.
    upper_bound
        A distance known to be at least the answer, which prunes the broad phase. Supply one when
        you have it -- from a previous frame, or from a bounding-volume gap -- and the vertex query
        that would otherwise derive it is skipped. **Too small a bound gives a wrong answer**, not a
        slow one: it culls the pair that would have won. ``None`` derives a sound bound.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : float
        The minimum distance. ``0.0`` exactly when some pair of faces crosses.
    face_a : int
        The face of the first mesh achieving it, or ``-1`` if either mesh is empty.
    face_b : int
        The face of the second mesh achieving it, or ``-1``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``upper_bound`` is negative.
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices_a``, ``faces_a``, ``vertices_b`` and ``faces_b`` are not all on one device.

    Notes
    -----
    !!! note "Witness faces are ambiguous under ties"
        Two parallel plates have a continuum of closest pairs and any of them is a correct answer,
        and ties are the common case rather than the exotic one: whenever the closest approach is
        realised at a *vertex*, every face around that vertex achieves the minimum exactly. The
        tie-break on ``face_a`` is the lowest index; ``face_b`` is **unspecified** among the faces
        attaining it, and which one comes back can differ between runs of the identical input even
        though the squared distance is bit-identical. Compare *distances* against another
        implementation, and faces only where the configuration is generic.

    Return unit face normals at the closest mesh triangle for each query point.

    For each position in ``points``, runs an unsigned closest-point query on

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh
        Warp mesh (BVH built by caller).
    points
        ``(m,)`` query positions as ``wp.vec3``.
    max_dist
        Maximum search radius per query. When ``None``, derived from the

    face_normals
        Optional length-``n_faces`` unit face normals of ``mesh``
        ([`face_normals_and_areas`][triwarp.triangles.face_normals_and_areas]); recomputed when

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.vec3]
        ``(m,)`` face normals at the closest triangle for each query. A query with no face
        within ``max_dist`` reports the first face's normal; use

    Signed distance from each query point to a triangle mesh (Warp SDF convention).

    Distances follow Warp's signed-distance field convention:

    * Points **outside** the mesh have **positive** distance.
    * Points **inside** have **negative** distance.
    * Points within [`TOLERANCE_MERGE`][triwarp.constants.TOLERANCE_MERGE] of the surface
      return positive unsigned distance.

    Trimesh ``signed_distance`` uses the opposite sign; negate its output to compare.
    See also [`contains_points`][triwarp.ray.contains_points] (inside iff signed distance is
    negative, except on the on-surface tolerance band).

    The **unsigned** distance is identical in both ``sign_mode`` values — only the sign differs.

    !!! note "Choosing a `sign_mode`"

        ``"parity"`` (default) uses ``wp.mesh_query_point_sign_parity``: it casts ``n_sample``
        perturbed rays and votes on the crossing parity. Exact on a watertight mesh, cheap, but
        it has no principled answer on an open or holed surface — a ray that escapes through a
        hole flips the verdict.

        ``"winding"`` uses ``wp.mesh_query_point_sign_winding_number``, which evaluates the
        *generalized winding number* on the mesh BVH (a Barnes-Hut style traversal governed by
        ``accuracy``) and compares it against ``winding_threshold``. This is the
        Jacobson et al. robust inside/outside criterion and it degrades gracefully on
        non-watertight input, which is why it is the mode to reach for on raw scan data.

        The two modes agree on watertight meshes, but on a surface with an open patch ``"winding"``
        reproduces the exact generalized winding number's sign far more often than ``"parity"``
        does. The cost is a slower query and a larger ``wp.Mesh``: ``support_winding_number=True``
        stores a solid-angle expansion per BVH node, using noticeably more device memory.

        ``"winding"`` is still much cheaper than thresholding
        [`winding_number`][triwarp.proximity.winding_number] yourself, because that sums the exact
        solid angle over *every* face for *every* query rather than using the BVH's Barnes-Hut
        traversal, and the gap widens with the face count. Reach for
        [`winding_number`][triwarp.proximity.winding_number] only when you need the winding
        *value* — Warp exposes no builtin for the approximated value, only its sign.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n,)`` mesh vertex positions as ``wp.vec3``.
    faces
        ``(f * 3,)`` flat triangle index array as ``wp.int32``.
        The internally built ``wp.Mesh`` aliases these buffers rather than copying them;
        do not mutate them for the duration of the call.
    points
        ``(m,)`` query positions in space as ``wp.vec3``.
    max_dist
        Maximum search radius per query. When ``None``, derived from the
        axis-aligned box enclosing mesh vertices and query points.
    sign_mode
        ``"parity"`` (default) for ray-parity sign, ``"winding"`` for the generalized
        winding-number sign. See the note above.
    n_sample
        Perturbed rays for parity voting (off-triangle sign branch). ``"parity"`` only.
    perturbation_scale
        Uniform perturbation scale for parity rays. ``"parity"`` only.
    accuracy
        Barnes-Hut accuracy for the winding-number traversal: a node is expanded when the query
        point is within ``accuracy`` times the node's radius, so larger values are more accurate
        and slower. ``"winding"`` only; Warp's default is ``2.0``.
    winding_threshold
        Winding number above which a point counts as inside. ``"winding"`` only; ``0.5`` is the
        standard choice for a once-wound closed surface.
    mesh
        A ``wp.Mesh`` already built over ``vertices`` and ``faces``, to spare the clone and BVH
        build. **Only valid with ``sign_mode="parity"``**: the winding mode needs a mesh built with
        ``support_winding_number=True``, and ``wp.Mesh`` exposes no way to read that flag back, so a
        supplied mesh cannot be checked and is refused rather than silently degraded to parity.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.float32]
        ``(m,)`` signed distances in ``float32``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError

    Sample the signed distance to a mesh on a regular lattice, as a field and the box it spans.

    The bridge from a surface to a **level set**, and the missing half of the implicit round trip:
    [`triwarp.voxels.to_field`][triwarp.voxels.to_field] already gives
    [`triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes`][triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes] an
    *occupancy* lattice, but occupancy is ``0`` or ``1`` and thresholding it at anything other than
    ``0.5`` does not move the surface anywhere. A distance field does, which is what makes
    ``marching_cubes(*signed_distance_grid(...), iso=d)`` an offset surface at distance ``d`` --
    see [`triwarp.levelset.offset_mesh`][triwarp.levelset.offset_mesh], the named entry point for
    it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer.
    voxel_size
        Lattice spacing, isotropic. ``None`` takes
        [`triwarp.voxels.resolve_voxel_grid`][triwarp.voxels.resolve_voxel_grid]'s default of 1 % of
        the bounding-box diagonal, which is this package's one definition of an unspecified grid.
    bounds
        ``(lower, upper)`` box to sample, **before** padding. ``None`` uses the mesh's own
        axis-aligned box, which is what an offset wants -- an inward offset needs no more, and an
        outward one needs ``pad`` to cover it.
    pad
        Cells of margin added on every side, so the lattice extends ``pad * voxel_size`` beyond the
        box. Two is enough for the surface itself to be enclosed; an **outward offset of ``d``
        needs ``pad >= d / voxel_size + 1``** or its level set is clipped by the lattice boundary.
    sign_mode
        How the sign is decided, forwarded to
        [`signed_distance_on_mesh`][triwarp.proximity.signed_distance_on_mesh]: ``"parity"`` counts
        ray crossings, ``"winding"`` sums solid angles and is the one that survives a mesh with open
        rims.
    mesh
        A ``wp.Mesh`` already built over ``vertices`` and ``faces``, to spare the build. Forwarded
        as-is, so ``signed_distance_on_mesh``'s rule applies unchanged: it is usable with
        ``sign_mode="parity"`` only, since the winding sign needs a mesh built with
        ``support_winding_number=True`` and that cannot be verified after construction.

    Returns
    -------
    field : twt.Array3dFloat32
        ``(nx, ny, nz)`` signed distances, negative inside. Exactly the first argument
        [`triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes`][triwarp.levelset.marching_cubes] takes.
    bounds : tuple[wp.vec3, wp.vec3]
        The ``(lower, upper)`` corners the lattice actually spans, padded and snapped so the spacing
        is exactly ``voxel_size`` on every axis. Pass it straight through as that function's
        ``bounds``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``voxel_size`` is not positive, ``pad`` is negative, or ``faces`` is empty.
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices``, ``faces`` and ``mesh`` are not all on one device.

    Examples
    --------
    ```python
    field, box = tw.proximity.signed_distance_grid(v, f, voxel_size=0.05, pad=4)
    shell_v, shell_f = tw.levelset.marching_cubes(field, 0.1, bounds=box)
    ```

    Notes
    -----
    **The whole lattice is sampled, so size it deliberately**: the field costs
    ``4 * nx * ny * nz`` bytes and one closest-point query per sample, which is 16.7 M queries and
    67 MB at ``256 ** 3``. There is no narrow band, and that is deliberate rather than missing --
    ``signed_distance_on_mesh`` reports ``+max_dist`` for a query that finds no face within the
    limit, so a banded field would carry a **positive** value deep inside the solid and silently
    invert the level set. Reduce the resolution instead.

    The lattice is a *corner* lattice: ``field[0, 0, 0]`` sits exactly on the returned ``lower``.
    That is [`triwarp.voxels.grid_points`][triwarp.voxels.grid_points]'s convention and
    ``marching_cubes``'s, and it is **not** the voxel-centre convention the rest of
    [`triwarp.voxels`][triwarp.voxels] uses.

    """
    Generalized winding number at each query point.

    Sums the signed solid angle subtended by each oriented triangle. For a
    closed, consistently oriented watertight mesh, interior points have
    winding number near ``1`` and exterior points near ``0``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n,)`` mesh vertex positions as ``wp.vec3``.
    faces
        ``(f * 3,)`` flat triangle index array as ``wp.int32``.
    points
        ``(m,)`` query positions in space as ``wp.vec3``.
    tiled
        When ``True`` (default), sum solid angles with the face list partitioned across
        threads: one thread per ``(query, face slice)`` walks a strided slice of
        [`ITEMS_PER_QUERY_SLICE`][triwarp.proximity.ITEMS_PER_QUERY_SLICE] faces and accumulates
        one ``wp.atomic_add`` per slice, so the summation order is nondeterministic and the result
        can differ in the last float32 digits between runs. When ``False``, each query thread
        loops over all faces serially — orders of magnitude slower on large meshes,
        but the fixed left-to-right summation makes it the exact-sum reference.

    Low-level mesh AABB query with per-query axis-aligned bounds.

    For each query primitive ``k``, tests intersection of ``[query_lower[k],

    At most ``max_hits`` candidate face indices are recorded per query.

    Requires the default Warp mesh BVH backend; ``bvh_constructor="cubql"`` meshes

    query_upper
        Length-``m`` upper corners of the query boxes.
    max_hits
        Maximum candidate faces recorded per query. Hits past this cap are dropped, so the

) -> wp.array[wp.int32]:
    """
    For each 2D query point, the triangle of a planar triangulation that contains it.

    Point location in the plane -- the primitive an inverse UV lookup needs, and the counterpart of
    [`triwarp.texture`][]'s forward direction: ``remap_attribute_from_uv`` *samples an image* at a
    UV coordinate, where this answers which triangle of a UV atlas a coordinate falls in, and so
    which surface point it corresponds to. Pair it with
    [`points_to_barycentric`][triwarp.triangles.points_to_barycentric] on the returned face to
    finish the inverse map.

    The triangulation must not overlap itself -- a UV atlas, a Delaunay triangulation, or the
    ``xy`` projection of a height field. Where triangles do overlap, each query gets one of the
    containing faces and which one is unspecified.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` planar vertex positions as ``wp.vec2``.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer.
    points
        ``(m,)`` planar query positions as ``wp.vec2``.

    Returns
    -------
    wp.array[wp.int32]
        Length ``m`` on ``vertices.device``: the containing triangle's index, or ``-1`` where the
        query lies outside the triangulation. A query exactly on a shared edge is inside *both* its
        triangles and which one is returned is not specified.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices``, ``faces`` and ``points`` are not all on one device.

    Notes
    -----
    Two stages: a closest-point query against the triangulation lifted to the ``z = 0`` plane picks
    a candidate face -- sufficient because a point inside any triangle is at distance zero from it,
    so the *closest* triangle contains it whenever one does -- and a barycentric sign test on the
    query's own coordinates decides. That reuses the BVH ``wp.Mesh`` already builds, at the cost of
    one lifted ``wp.vec3`` copy of ``vertices``.

    The second stage is not redundant: deciding on the query radius alone misclassifies some
    queries, because an in-plane point's closest-point distance is not exactly zero in
    ``float32`` and no radius threshold separates every interior point from every exterior one.
    The barycentric test is much sharper, so the radius is only a search bound and there is no
    tolerance to tune.

    Building that BVH happens on every call, so a caller locating several point sets against the
    same triangulation pays for it each time -- there is no prebuilt-index entry point.
