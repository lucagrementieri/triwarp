Mesh boundary edges and vertices.

A mesh edge lies on the boundary when it appears exactly once among all triangle edges.
Boundary detection radix-sorts every halfedge's undirected edge key with the halfedge's index as
the payload (the analog of ``trimesh.grouping.group_rows(require_count=1)``): a key occurring
exactly once is a boundary edge, and its halfedge names the face corner it came from.

Every loop-shaped entry point comes in two forms, and the pairing is the module's one convention
worth stating up front: a **list** form returning or taking one ``wp.array`` per loop
([`boundary_loops`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops],
[`loop_perimeters`][triwarp.boundary.loop_perimeters],
[`loop_directed_areas`][triwarp.boundary.loop_directed_areas]) and a ``_batched`` form over one
packed buffer plus per-loop offsets and sizes
([`boundary_loops_batched`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops_batched],
[`loop_perimeters_batched`][triwarp.boundary.loop_perimeters_batched],
[`loop_directed_areas_batched`][triwarp.boundary.loop_directed_areas_batched]). They compute the
same answer; the packed form is the one whose cost is independent of the loop *count*, and it is
what [`triwarp.holes`][triwarp.holes] carries its rims in from end to end. The list forms pack and
delegate, so there is one segmented launch behind each measure rather than one per form.

    Ordered vertex-index loops along each mesh boundary.

    Each boundary loop is a simple cycle in the directed-boundary-edge successor graph (on a
    manifold boundary every boundary vertex has exactly one outgoing boundary edge). Loops are
    grouped via connected-component labeling, then each vertex's ordinal position within its
    loop is ranked by following the successor chain from itself to its loop's canonical start
    (the smallest vertex index in the loop) — entirely GPU-parallel, mirroring
    ``igl::boundary_loop`` (its first overload).

    All loops are found in one batched pass
    ([`boundary_loops_batched`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops_batched]); this is
    [`split`][triwarp.array.split] over its packed result.

    !!! note "The returned arrays are views"
        Each loop slices the single packed buffer ``boundary_loops_batched`` produced, which costs
        no device memory and no launches. Two consequences: holding on to a single loop keeps the
        *whole* buffer alive, and writing into one loop writes into the shared allocation. Pass
        ``copy=True`` for independent buffers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` vertex positions; only the count is used, as the successor-array
        size and the edge-key radix, so every face index must be below it.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` face index buffer.
    edges_sorted
        Optional precomputed ``(n_faces * 3, 2)`` sorted edges, forwarded to
        [`boundary_loops_batched`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops_batched].
    edges
        Optional precomputed ``(n_faces * 3, 2)`` directed edges, forwarded to
        [`boundary_loops_batched`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops_batched].
    copy
        Return independent buffers instead of views into the packed result.

    Returns
    -------
    list[wp.array[wp.int32]]
        One array per boundary loop, each holding the ordered vertex indices around that loop
        (not repeating the start vertex), on ``faces.device``. Empty list when the mesh has no
        boundary.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``vertices``, ``faces``, ``edges_sorted`` and ``edges`` are not all on one device.

    Notes
    -----
    A vertex where the rim meets itself (a non-manifold **pinch** point, as deleting two faces that
    share only a corner leaves) is walked by halfedge sector rather than by vertex: the loops are
    the boundary of the surface with that vertex split once per fan, so every boundary edge
    appears exactly once and every consecutive pair is a real boundary edge -- but a loop can pass
    through a pinch vertex more than once, where two holes touch there. That needs an
    edge-manifold mesh; on one that is not, the loops are bounded but unspecified.

    Orientability is *not* assumed. On a non-orientable surface the winding cannot orient the
    boundary globally -- at the seam two boundary edges leave the same vertex -- so the loops are
    recovered from the undirected edges instead, and their direction is then an arbitrary but
    reproducible choice rather than the face winding's. Only the direction is arbitrary; the loops
    themselves are exact. Costs one extra host readback to detect the case.

    Count the boundary edges and detect whether their directed rows have a seam or a pinch.

    Returns whether the rows have an orientation seam and whether they have a pinch; the count is

    They have neither on an orientable surface with a manifold boundary, which is what lets
    [`boundary_loops_batched`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops_batched] hand them straight to
    [`successor_cycles`][triwarp.graph.successor_cycles]. The two defects break that differently
    and each has its own walk:

    - **A non-orientable seam.** The winding cannot be made consistent globally, so at the seam two
      boundary edges leave the same vertex and ``succ[tail] = head`` drops one silently. On the
      Moebius fixture, exactly one vertex of 78 has out-degree 2, and the walk that follows returns
      78 entries over only 40 distinct vertices. The boundary is still 2-regular, so
      [`_unoriented_boundary_cycles`][triwarp.boundary._unoriented_boundary_cycles] recovers it
      exactly.
    - **A pinch point**, where two loops meet at one vertex, which then has four boundary
      incidences -- and, on a consistently wound surface, two out-edges as well, so a pinch raises
      *both* flags. No walk over vertices exists at all, but one over halfedges does:
      [`_pinched_boundary_cycles`][triwarp.boundary._pinched_boundary_cycles].

    Conflating them is easy: an icosphere with every seventh face removed has pinch points but no
    orientability problem, and a gate reading only out-degree would send it down the undirected
    walk, which has nothing to offer a vertex of degree four.

    No pass and no readback of its own: the degree census rides in the launch that flags the
    boundary runs (``kernels/boundary.mark_boundary_runs``), and its two bits come back in the one
    readback that sizes the boundary. Neither flag needs a pass over the *vertices*: only a
    boundary vertex ever has a non-zero degree, and the thread that pushes one past its threshold
    learns so from the value its own ``wp.atomic_add`` returns.

    Boundary cycles of a rim that meets itself at a vertex: walk the boundary *halfedges* instead.

    At a pinch the vertex successor table has two writers and no answer, which is why the vertex
    walk came back with slots left at ``0``. A boundary halfedge has exactly one successor -- the
    next boundary halfedge around its tip within its own sector
    (``kernels/halfedge.next_boundary_halfedge``) -- so the halfedges form a true successor graph
    and [`successor_cycles`][triwarp.graph.successor_cycles] walks it unchanged. Each cycle is then
    read back as the origin vertex of each halfedge, which keeps the face winding's direction.

    So the cycles are the boundary of the surface with each pinch vertex split once per fan: every
    boundary edge appears exactly once, and a cycle can pass through a pinch vertex twice where two
    holes touch there (one fan hands the walk from the first rim to the second, the other hands it
    back). Only this branch builds a twin table (``validate=False``: a mesh

    Boundary cycles of a mesh whose winding cannot orient them: walk the undirected edges instead.

    A manifold boundary is 2-regular whether or not the surface is orientable, so the cycles exist
    even where a *consistent direction* for them does not. The walk runs on **darts**: dart ``2 * v
    + s`` means "at vertex ``v``, arrived from neighbour slot ``s``", and its successor leaves by
    the other slot. That is a genuine successor graph by construction -- every dart has exactly one
    out-edge -- so [`successor_cycles`][triwarp.graph.successor_cycles] handles it unchanged, at
    twice the node count.

    Each undirected cycle therefore comes back **twice**, once per direction, over disjoint dart
    sets. The two mirrors share their lowest vertex ``v`` but start at darts ``2v`` and ``2v + 1``,
    so keeping the even-starting one picks exactly one per pair. With the neighbour slots sorted
    ascending, that direction is "leave the lowest vertex toward its larger neighbour" -- an
    arbitrary but *reproducible* choice, which is the honest answer when no winding defines one.

    On a Moebius band this returns the single cycle the surface actually has, with every consecutive
    pair a real boundary edge. Two references get it wrong in different ways and neither is worth
    matching: ``igl.boundary_loop_all`` cuts that cycle into open chains, each with one consecutive
    pair that is *not* a boundary edge, and a half-edge hole ring walks the band's *double* cover
    and reads twice the length.

    The mirror filter and the re-pack run on the host, over a buffer bounded by the **boundary**
    rather than by the mesh, and only ever on a non-orientable surface. Two things make that the
    right side of the fence rather than an unfinished port. The host loop is over *cycles*, not over
    darts -- twice the boundary-loop count, so two iterations on a Moebius band -- and each
    iteration's body is a vectorized slice rather than a per-element Python step. And the device
    alternative is a segment compaction (a keep mask, a ``counts_to_offsets`` scan and a gather)
    that only pays for itself on a mesh with many boundary loops that is also non-orientable.

    Perimeter of every loop, taking the loops in the packed form rather than as a list.

    Same measure as [`loop_perimeters`][triwarp.boundary.loop_perimeters] and the same launch; the
    three arguments after ``vertices`` are exactly what
    [`boundary_loops_batched`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops_batched] returns, in that order.
    Reach for this whenever the loops are already packed, which is the form
    [`triwarp.holes`][triwarp.holes] carries them in throughout: the list form would have to be
    split back out and repacked to be measured, and the split is a per-loop Python object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    flat_loops
        Concatenated ordered vertex indices of every loop.
    offsets
        Length-``n_loops`` start of each loop in ``flat_loops``. Not total-terminated, matching
        ``boundary_loops_batched``.
    loop_sizes
        Length-``n_loops`` vertex count per loop.
    loop_id
        Optional precomputed length-``flat_loops`` label saying which loop each packed position
        belongs to. Built here when ``None``, which costs an allocation, a copy and a launch --
        **roughly doubling the call**, since the measure itself is one launch. Pass it when the
        caller already holds it, as [`triwarp.holes`][triwarp.holes] does.
    validate
        When ``True`` (default), check that ``offsets`` and ``loop_sizes`` agree in length and that
        every ``(offset, size)`` pair stays within ``flat_loops`` before launching -- a real cost (a
        host readback of both arrays), paid because a hand-built or stale packed triple otherwise
        drives the kernel's per-loop index past ``flat_loops``'s end with no exception raised. Pass
        ``False`` only when the triple is known correct by construction, as
        [`triwarp.holes`][triwarp.holes]'s internal packing already is.

    Directed area vector of every loop, in one launch.

    Half the sum of ``p_i x p_{i+1}`` around each cycle. Its **norm** is the area of the planar
    polygon the loop spans and its **direction** is that polygon's normal, oriented by the loop's
    own winding -- so it answers "how big is this hole" and "which way does it face" at once, and
    the sign flips if the loop is reversed. A vector rather than a scalar for that reason: the area
    alone loses the orientation, which is what tells an outer boundary from an inner one.

    Origin-independent, because the cross products of a closed ring cancel any shift of the origin,
    so no centroid pass is needed. Exact for a planar loop; for a non-planar one it is the area of
    the loop's projection onto the plane normal to the result, which is the standard convention.

    """
    Find ear faces (triangles with exactly two boundary edges).

    For each ear face, ``ear_opp`` is the local index of the non-boundary edge, where local edge
    ``i`` is ``(faces[f, i], faces[f, (i + 1) % 3])``.

    !!! note "``igl::ears`` numbers the edge differently"

        The same quantity in ``igl.ears`` is indexed *opposite-vertex* style -- edge ``i`` is the
        one facing vertex ``i``, ``(faces[f, (i + 1) % 3], faces[f, (i + 2) % 3])`` -- because it
        reads its mask from ``igl::on_boundary``, whose columns are documented that way. The two
        agree on *which* faces are ears and differ on the index by a cyclic shift:
        ``triwarp_opp == (igl_opp + 1) % 3``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` face index buffer.
    edges_sorted
        Optional precomputed ``(n_faces * 3, 2)`` sorted edges (each row min-first), as from
        [`faces_to_edges`][triwarp.edges.faces_to_edges] with ``sorted=True``. Built from
        ``faces`` when ``None``.

    Returns
    -------
    ear : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Face indices of ear triangles on ``faces.device``, ascending. Empty when no ears exist.
    ear_opp : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Local edge index of the interior edge for each ear face, same length as ``ear``.

    Raises
    ------
