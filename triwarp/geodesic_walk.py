"""
Straightest geodesics: walk a fixed distance across a mesh in a fixed direction.

A *straightest* geodesic is what you get by walking forward and, at every edge, unfolding the two
incident triangles into a common plane and continuing in a straight line. It is the surface analogue
of "go that way for this far", which makes it the tool for exponential maps, streamline tracing
and
extending a direction field along a surface — and unlike a shortest path it is fixed by an initial
condition rather than by two endpoints.

Both entry points are batched over many rays: one thread walks one ray, and the traced polylines
come back packed into one buffer with CSR offsets, the same shape
[`boundary_loops_batched`][triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops_batched] uses.

[`trace_from_vertex`][triwarp.geodesic_walk.trace_from_vertex] is the **exponential map** of the
surface, and its inverse is [`log_map`][triwarp.heat.log_map]: one takes a tangent direction
and a distance to a point, the other takes a point back to the direction and distance that reach it.
The two live apart because they are different methods -- this one unfolds triangles combinatorially,
that one solves a vector-heat system -- and geodesic *distance* by the heat method is a third,
[`heat_geodesic`][triwarp.heat.heat_geodesic].

!!! note "Cone points"
    A path that runs exactly into a vertex has no unique straightest continuation — the angle around
    a vertex is not ``2 * pi``, so "straight through" is ambiguous. Such a crossing is resolved by
    unfolding across the edge the walk reached the vertex along: the correct limit for a path
    passing arbitrarily close to the vertex, but not the split-the-angle convention. Paths through
    high-curvature vertices therefore drift from geometry-central's by about the angle defect.

    Trace a straightest geodesic from each of a batch of vertices.

    Each ray starts at ``vertices[start_vertices[r]]`` and walks in ``directions[r]``, for an arc
    length equal to that direction's length *after projection into the vertex's tangent plane* — a
    unit direction traces at most a unit distance, and a direction along the normal traces nothing.
    That is ``potpourri3d.GeodesicTracer``'s convention too.

    Which incident face the ray starts in is decided in the vertex's *flattened* tangent space
    ([`halfedge_tangent_angles`][triwarp.tangent_space.halfedge_tangent_angles]): rescaling the
    incident corner angles to a full turn makes the fan a disk, so every tangent direction lands in
    exactly one wedge, including directions a naive per-face projection would place outside all of
    them. At a boundary vertex the fan spans only half a disk, and a direction outside it — pointing
    off the surface — traces nothing.

    A walk stops early when it reaches the mesh boundary or exceeds ``max_steps`` edge crossings.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    start_vertices
        ``(n_rays,)`` ``wp.int32`` start vertex per ray.
    directions
        ``(n_rays,)`` initial directions; the length of each sets how far its ray is traced.
    twins
        Optional precomputed [`halfedge_twins`][triwarp.halfedge.halfedge_twins].
    rings
        Optional precomputed [`vertex_one_rings`][triwarp.halfedge.vertex_one_rings], used to find
        each ray's starting face.
    frames
        Optional precomputed [`vertex_tangent_frames`][triwarp.tangent_space.vertex_tangent_frames].
        They define each vertex's tangent plane, which sets both the trace length and the starting
        wedge.
    max_steps
        Maximum edge crossings per ray.

    Returns
    -------
    points : wp.array[wp.vec3]
        All traced points, packed ray after ray, on ``vertices.device``.
    offsets : wp.array[wp.int32]
        Length ``n_rays + 1``; ray ``r`` owns ``points[offsets[r] : offsets[r + 1]]``, beginning at
        its start vertex. A ray always contributes at least one point.

    """
    Follow a per-vertex scalar field downhill from each of a batch of start vertices.

    The **field-descent** counterpart of this module's two straightest-geodesic tracers: where those
    are fixed by an initial direction, this one is fixed by a *field*, and it goes wherever that
    field decreases fastest. Fed a geodesic distance field it traces the geodesic back to its
    source, which is what [`geodesic_path`][triwarp.geodesic_walk.geodesic_path] is; fed any other
    scalar it traces that scalar's flow lines.

    Three cases, and the field value at each written point strictly decreases in all of them --
    which is what makes the walk terminate rather than orbit:

    1. **Inside a face** the piecewise-linear interpolant's gradient is constant, so the path is a
       straight segment to the exit edge.
    2. **Along an edge**, when the face across it has a descent that points back: the walk slides to
       the edge's lower-valued endpoint.
    3. **At a vertex**, where the field has no single gradient: each incident face is asked whether
       its own descent direction points into the fan wedge, and the steepest admissible one wins.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer.
    values
        Length-``n_vertices`` ``wp.float64`` field to descend. ``float64`` because the fields this
        serves are exponentially decaying -- see
        [`triwarp.laplacian.face_gradients`][triwarp.laplacian.face_gradients], which computes the
        per-face gradient this walks along.
    starts
        ``(n_paths,)`` ``wp.int32`` vertices to descend from, one path each.
    stop_value
        Field value at which a path stops. The default ``0.0`` is what a distance field's source
        sits at.
    twins
        Optional precomputed [`triwarp.halfedge.halfedge_twins`][triwarp.halfedge.halfedge_twins].
    vertex_faces
        Optional precomputed
        [`triwarp.adjacency.vertex_face_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.vertex_face_adjacency] pair,
        which case 3 needs. ``(vertex_faces, offsets)``, values first, as that function returns it
        and as every packed pair in the package is spelled -- passing it the other way round reads
        offsets as face indices and raises nothing, since both are ``wp.int32``.
    gradients
        Optional precomputed per-face gradient of ``values``. Pass it when descending the same field
        from several batches.
    max_steps
        Cap on steps per path. A path that hits it is returned truncated rather than reported.

    Returns
    -------
    points, offsets
        ``points`` holds every path's polyline end to end and ``offsets`` is the
        length-``n_paths + 1`` CSR bound, the same packing
        [`trace_from_vertex`][triwarp.geodesic_walk.trace_from_vertex] returns and
        [`trace_polylines`][triwarp.geodesic_walk.trace_polylines] slices.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``values`` does not have one entry per vertex.

    Notes
    -----
    A path can stop before reaching ``stop_value``, and the caller can tell: its last point is not
    within tolerance of a vertex whose value is at the stop. That happens at a **local minimum** of
    the field, on a flat face where the gradient vanishes, at the mesh **boundary**, and when
    ``max_steps`` runs out. None of those is an error -- a field with several minima has several
    basins, and this walks the one it starts in.

    The **point-to-point** geodesic, as against this module's straightest walks and

    the distance to the source everywhere, and descending it from a target follows that geodesic
    back. Every target shares the one solve, so a thousand paths to one source cost one system and a
    thousand independent walks -- which is why the signature is one source and many targets rather
    than a list of pairs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` flat triangle index buffer.
    source
        ``(k,)`` ``wp.int32`` source vertices. Several make the paths run to whichever is nearest,
        since the field is the distance to the *set*.
    targets
        ``(n_paths,)`` ``wp.int32`` vertices to trace from.
    t
        Heat diffusion time, forwarded to
        [`heat_geodesic`][triwarp.heat.heat_geodesic]. ``None`` uses its default.
    operators
        Prebuilt [`HeatOperators`][triwarp.heat.HeatOperators] for this mesh, to spare the
        factorization when several sources are traced on one mesh.
    max_steps
        Cap on steps per path.

    Returns
    -------
    points, offsets
        Packed polylines and their CSR bounds, each running **from its target to the source**. Slice
        with [`trace_polylines`][triwarp.geodesic_walk.trace_polylines] and measure with

    ```python
    source = tw.array.arange(1, device=v.device)
    targets = tw.array.arange(int(v.shape[0]), device=v.device)
    points, offsets = tw.geodesic_walk.geodesic_path(v, f, source, targets)
    ```

    Notes
    -----
    **The path is as accurate as the field it descends, and no more.** The heat method's distance is
    first-order, so this is an *approximate* geodesic: measured against ``potpourri3d``'s edge-flip
    geodesics -- which are exact -- the length comes out a few per cent long, and the excess is the
    field's error rather than the walk's. It is never *shorter* than the true geodesic, which is the
    invariant worth testing against.

    A path that cannot reach the source stops early rather than failing; see
    [`descend_field`][triwarp.geodesic_walk.descend_field] for the four ways that happens.

    Shorten closed edge loops within their homotopy class, keeping them on mesh edges.

    Takes exactly what [`homology_generators`][triwarp.homology.homology_generators] returns -- a
    list of vertex-index cycles -- and returns cycles of the same kind, shorter. The loops a
    tree-cotree construction produces are as long and as jagged as the spanning trees that built
    them, which is fine for a *basis* and useless as a curve; this makes them short enough to look
    at, cut along, or measure.

    Each sweep rewrites the loop *locally*. Around one of its vertices ``b``, with neighbours ``a``
    and ``c`` on the loop, the sub-path ``a -> b -> c`` is replaced by whichever way round ``b``'s
    link is shorter, when either beats going through ``b``. Both alternatives lie in the star of
    ``b``, which is a disk, so the replacement cannot change the loop's homotopy class -- and since
    it is only ever accepted when it is strictly shorter, the total length falls monotonically. A
    loop that doubles back on itself has the spur contracted away by the same rule.

    !!! note "Shorter, not geodesic"
        The result stays **on the edge graph**, so it is a local minimum over edge paths rather than
        the shortest curve on the surface -- reaching that means letting the loop cross face
        interiors, which needs an intrinsic triangulation it can flip. The gap is small: measured
        against ``potpourri3d.EdgeFlipGeodesicSolver.find_geodesic_loop`` started from this very
        output, **1.066x to 1.578x** of the geodesic length across three tori and a genus-2 union.
        It is widest where the mesh is a regular grid whose rows are not geodesics, because no
        one-ring move can step the loop off a row without lengthening the edge path first -- so the
        result is a true local minimum over edge paths, and the remaining gap is the edge graph's,
        not the sweep's. What it does deliver is the reduction from the tree-cotree loop it starts
        from: **1.03x to 1.41x** shorter over the same four meshes.

        Sweeps ratchet the loop one position at a time, so the count needed grows with the loop --
        12 sweeps for a 24x12 torus, 48 for 96x48 -- which is what ``max_iter`` has to cover.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices
        ``(n_vertices,)`` mesh vertex positions.
    faces
        Length-``3 * n_faces`` ``wp.int32`` triangle index buffer.
    loops
        Closed vertex-index cycles, each a ``wp.int32`` array whose consecutive entries share an
        edge, as do its last and first. Loops shorter than three vertices are returned unchanged.
    max_iter
        Cap on the number of sweeps. Two sweeps of opposite parity are needed to give every
        position a turn, so an odd cap leaves one parity class one visit short. Sweeping stops as
        soon as two consecutive sweeps accept nothing, which is what makes the default generous
        rather than expensive.
    tolerance
        Absolute length a replacement must save to be accepted. The default ``0.0`` accepts any
        strict improvement, which is what makes the result independent of the sweep count; raise it
        to stop the last few sweeps chasing float32 noise on a fine mesh.
    twins
        Optional precomputed [`halfedge_twins`][triwarp.halfedge.halfedge_twins].
    rings
        Optional precomputed [`vertex_one_rings`][triwarp.halfedge.vertex_one_rings] as
        ``(ring_halfedges, offsets, is_boundary)``. Depends on the connectivity alone, so one CSR
        serves every fan walk over the same mesh --
        [`Trimesh.vertex_one_rings`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.vertex_one_rings] has it cached, and
        passing it skips the vertex-manifold check and the host readback that check costs.

    Returns
    -------
    loops : list[wp.array[wp.int32]]
        One shortened cycle per input loop, in the same order, on ``faces.device``.
    sweeps : int
        How many sweeps ran. Below ``max_iter`` this means the loops stopped changing, so the
        answer is locally minimal; equal to it, the cap bound the result.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any loop is not a rank-1 ``wp.int32`` array.
