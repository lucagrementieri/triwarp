# Slot table for the **device-side round loop**: one zero-initialized ``wp.array[wp.int32]`` that a
# ``dim=1`` kernel updates at the end of each round, so ``wp.capture_while`` can drive the rounds
# with no host readback. Slot 0 counts rounds -- read against a cap, which is what bounds a loop
# whose progress test could otherwise stall -- and slot 1 is the condition; the wrapper hands
# ``wp.capture_while`` the view ``state[LOOP_CONDITION_VIEW]``.
#
# The condition is written by a **plain store**, never an atomic: it is one address taking one
# value, so there is nothing to serialize even where every thread of a wide launch may write it
# (``polyline.rdp_split_spans``, ``homology.forest_link``). **It must be seeded non-zero before the
# loop starts**: ``wp.capture_while`` evaluates it *before* the first round, so a plain
# ``wp.zeros`` state runs zero rounds. Seed with ``wp.array([0, 1])`` / ``assign([0, 1])``, or from
# the kernel that resets the rest of the pass (``remesh.begin_decimation_pass``).
#
# Six loops share this, in two shapes. **Arm-at-the-front**: a round's first kernel clears the
# condition and a later one raises it, so two slots are enough -- the level-synchronous
# Ramer-Douglas-Peucker and the ear-clipping rounds in ``kernels/polyline.py``, the conjugate
# gradient's iteration test, and ``kernels/remesh.py``'s collapse rounds, which needs a third slot
# for the previous round's commit count and **appends** it so the shared two keep their numbers.
# **Publish-at-the-back**: the round raises ``LOOP_PROGRESS`` and a closing ``loop_advance`` turns
# it into the condition, which is what a loop with a *round cap* needs, since the cap is only known
# once the round index has been stepped -- ``graph.shortest_path_envelope``'s relaxation passes and
# both of ``kernels/homology.py``'s (the breadth-first level loop and the Boruvka forest rounds).
# ``kernels/algorithms/bfs.py`` deliberately shares neither: its seven slots are a frontier window
# (``start``, ``tail``) rather than a round counter, so slot 0 does not mean the same thing.

# arithmetic through Warp's Python-scope builtin dispatch, an order of magnitude dearer than the
# identical view taken with plain ints, and every round loop in the package took one or two per
# call. Both bounds have to be unwrapped -- ``__getitem__`` forms ``stop - start`` and
# ``strides * start`` itself, so one Warp-typed bound is three dispatches. Derived from the

    #
    # The progress flag has to be *cleared here* rather than by the round's own first kernel,

    # test of that claim must sit in the same body, which is what makes this the closing kernel and

# ``wp.map`` has the same lazy-instantiation property ``_register_overloads`` exists for, and the
# same fix: a ``wp.map(op, ...)`` call generates a module named ``map_<unqualified op name>``, each
# distinct *call signature* forks its hash, and a module's hash covers the kernels instantiated in
# it. Declaring the signatures up front with ``return_kernel=True`` reaches the final module
# directly for milliseconds of import. The chain is order-dependent, so this is a developer-loop
# tax rather than a one-time install cost (CLAUDE.md section 3.5).
#
# **The fork axis is not only the dtype, and that is the part that is not guessable.**
# ``warp._src.utils.map`` keys its cache on ``(is_array, type(input).__name__, dtype, ndim,
# broadcast_mask)`` per input, where ``broadcast_mask`` is ``tuple(d == 1 for d in shape)``. Three
# things fork a module that a dtype census cannot see: a **length-1** array (the commonest axis in
# the tree -- it is how every reduction-into-a-scalar wrapper calls ``wp.map``); an
# **``indexedarray``**, i.e. a Python-scope gather view; and the **rank**.
#
# **The table is what the wrappers' dispatch reaches, not what the ops admit** (no speculative
# generality). Generate it by monkeypatching ``wp.map`` over a full ``tests/`` run and recording
# Warp's own cache key, so a new signature is a measurement rather than a guess; only ops that
# actually fork are listed. **The gate is the load count**: distinct
# ``(map_* module, hash, device, block_dim)`` loads against distinct ``(module, device, block_dim)``
# pairs, whose floor is one module per op per device. A non-zero excess names the op that reopened
# a chain.
#
# **Placement is decided by the shape of the imports.** Several of the longest chains are Warp
# *builtins*, so one generated module is shared across several wrapper modules and every
# declaration for it must run before the *first* launch from any of them; those live here, because
# this module is reached first. Ops belonging to a single kernel module are declared at that
# module's own bottom — they *cannot* be declared here, since those modules import this one.
#
# One cost that looks like a regression and is not: the first ``wp.zeros`` below forces
# ``wp.init()``, so ``import triwarp.kernels.array`` alone gets much slower. A process that imports
# a wrapper *and does one call* is unchanged, and ``import triwarp`` is untouched because PEP 562
# keeps it from importing any of this.

# Segmented copy: many separate arrays into one buffer, in a single launch.
#
# ``array._pack_segments`` issues one ``wp.copy`` per segment on the small-segment path, a host
# cost linear in the segment count and independent of the data volume. **Warp does have an
# array-of-arrays**, contrary to a long-standing comment there: a ``@wp.struct`` may carry a
# ``wp.array`` field, and a ``wp.array`` of that struct is exactly a descriptor table, which
# ``segments[s].data`` indexes from kernel scope.
#
# The kernel form is **flat in both the segment count and the data volume**, where the copy loop is
# linear in the segment count, so the two cross at a couple of dozen segments and the kernel wins by
# orders of magnitude above that. The whole choice is therefore a segment-count threshold; see
# ``array.PACK_SEGMENTS_KERNEL_FROM``.
#
# **One kernel serves every dtype**, rather than a table of them. The descriptor's array field is
# declared ``wp.array[wp.int32]`` and pointed at the segment's storage with a length in 4-byte
# *words*, and the destination is aliased the same way, so this is a byte copy that never names the
# caller's dtype -- verified byte-identical for ``int32``, ``float32``, ``float64``, ``vec3`` and
# ``uint64``. A dtype whose itemsize is not a multiple of 4 (``bool``, ``int8``, ``int16``) cannot
# be addressed this way and keeps the copy loop.
