# field by a ``float32`` weight and sums, and Warp requires both operands of that product to share a
# scalar type, so the admissible fields are exactly the ``float32``-scalar ones this package
# transfers -- a scalar, a ``wp.vec2`` UV, a ``wp.vec3`` position / normal / colour. The three
# tables register the same set because a caller who can move a UV through
# ``transfer_through_operator`` must be able to move it through the closest-point transfer too; the
# operator path is documented as the preferred one *when an operator exists*, which makes the other
# two its fallback rather than a narrower API. A ``float64`` field is deliberately absent -- these
# operators are assembled from ``float32`` vertex data, so carrying one would advertise precision
# the weights do not have.
