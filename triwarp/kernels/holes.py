# was not already wasting on its ~1 024-wide grid.
#
# **Two values, and the choice is an occupancy question rather than a rim-length one.** The grid is
# ``(n_loops, max_size - span)``, so a *wide* block only pays when that grid on its own would
# starve the device -- which is CLAUDE.md section 2.3's block-per-item rule in a second place, and
# getting it backwards costs over 10 %. Measured with the emitted face buffer identical at every
# block size: the wide block wins at one or two long rims and **loses from a few dozen rims up,
# whatever the rim length** -- the case with the longest spans and a hundred of them is the worst
# loss, which is what rules out keying on rim length alone. Hence both conditions in
# ``hole_dp_block``: a long rim for the lanes to have work, and few enough rims that the grid needs
# them. Within the winning corner the size of the win is mesh-dependent, so treat the thresholds as

# on the rim length alone; it was caught by an A/B on a *scattered* deleted region, not by the
# benchmark rows, so a many-rim case belongs in any future sweep of it. The old tie-break reason
# still stands on its own terms -- a single-warp block takes the ``warp_count == 1`` fast path in
# Warp's ``tile_reduce_impl`` -- it is simply outweighed when the grid is narrow and the apex loop

# Spans per recorded CUDA graph in ``holes._run_hole_dp``, and the two bounds on when recording
# one pays at all.
#
# The span sweep is a chain of ``max_B - 2`` launches differing only in which span they compute,
# and through the middle of its range the *host* is the critical path: at a 512-vertex rim its 510
# launches cost more wall than the kernels they issue, which overlap underneath them. Moving the
# span onto the device (``HoleFillTables.span_base``) makes the launches identical, so one group of
# ``HOLE_DP_GRAPH_SPANS`` can be recorded once and replayed over the whole sweep -- and a replayed
# launch costs a fraction of an issued one.
#
# **The group size is a shallow optimum and the two bounds are not.** Swept over the real sweep
# at four rim lengths, 8 won at every one and 16 came within a few percent; 64 and up lose,
# because recording costs one ordinary launch per span in the group. Both bounds below were
# measured the same way, interleaved in one clock state, with the emitted face buffer
# byte-identical throughout.
#
# The lower bound is the sweep length, because recording is paid once against a sequence it has to
# be short beside -- this is the "record and replay once" case, which loses outright:
#
#     spans   6     10    14    22    30    46    62
#     ratio   0.57x 0.73x 0.84x 0.99x 1.20x 1.32x 1.44x
#
# The upper bound is the *device work a span launch carries*, which is what decides whether the
# host was ever the critical path: a span level evaluates ``n_loops * (B - span) * (span - 1)``
# apex candidates, so ``n_loops * B^2`` is that count up to a constant. Past the crossover the
# kernels already cover their own launches and replaying them only adds the per-group advance. The
# quantity separates rim *length* from rim *count* correctly, which is why it is not a bound on B:
#
#     n_loops*B^2   0.52M 0.59M 0.82M 0.88M 0.99M 1.05M 1.18M 1.57M 1.61M
#     ratio         1.44x 1.34x 1.25x 1.07x 1.07x 1.03x 0.99x 0.91x 0.96x
#
# Two readings that are *not* the cause of the far end and were each measured away rather than
# assumed: the replayed group's over-wide grid is free (0.91-1.02x for the same sweep issued at
# maximal width, device-bound and host-bound alike), and the group size does not rescue it (every
# size from 8 to 128 loses at 2 rims of 1 024).

    The hole-filling DP's invariant inputs, bundled so the per-span launches carry one argument.

    ``holes._run_hole_dp`` runs ``fill_dp_span`` once per span -- ``max_B - 2`` times for the whole
    mesh -- and every one of these values is the same on every launch. A ``wp.launch`` argument
    costs about a microsecond of host time, linearly and on both devices, so a 16-argument kernel
    launched hundreds of times spent milliseconds marshalling constants. Only the span offset
    stays an argument.

    **``dp`` and ``prev`` are in here too, and that is a measured decision rather than a tidy
    one.** They are the launch's in-place *output*, so leaving them as arguments reads better and
    that is how this struct originally drew the line. But their pointers do not change across the
    sweep either, and wherever the host is the sweep's critical path that legibility costs a real
    fraction of the call. Moving the two in is a clear win on a long rim and flat on a short one,
    whose sweep is a few dozen launches rather than hundreds. It still pays where the sweep is
    *recorded* rather than issued, because recording marshals each launch exactly once as an
    ordinary one, and on the CPU device, which never records at all.
    ``holes._run_hole_dp`` binds them once, right where it binds everything else.

    **``span_base`` is here for a different reason, and it is what lets the sweep be captured.**
    The per-span launches differ in exactly one thing -- which span they are -- so moving that one
    value onto the device makes consecutive launches *identical*, and an identical sequence is the
    one thing CUDA graph capture pays for. The launch argument is then the offset within the
    recorded group and ``span_base[0]`` is the group's first span, stepped on the device by
    [`advance_span_base`][triwarp.kernels.holes.advance_span_base]. See ``holes._run_hole_dp``.

    Build it ONCE in the wrapper and reuse it: construction is not free, and doing it per launch
    would give most of the saving back.

    A cross-*session* before/after read this as a win on the long rims and a loss on the short ones;
    the loss was drift in the surrounding work, which is what interleaving in one clock state is
    for.
