"""
Kernels for the shared sparse linear-algebra layer (``triwarp/linalg.py``).

The **reduced-system assembly** used by every fixed-value quadratic solve (``harmonic`` / ``tutte``
/ ``lscm`` / ``arap``). It is a **CSR-to-CSR** extraction in two passes -- count the surviving
entries per free row, then fill them -- rather than a COO emission handed to
``warp.sparse.bsr_from_triplets``. The input rows come out of a CSR, so they are already row-major,
already column-sorted and already duplicate-free, and ``free_map`` is monotone, so the extracted
row is sorted by construction: the sort and duplicate-accumulation a triplet build performs are pure
waste here, and that build was the overwhelming majority of ``min_quad_with_fixed``'s device time.

The module's other half, the batched conjugate-gradient iteration that solves the system this
assembles, lives in ``triwarp.kernels.algorithms.conjugate_gradient``.

!!! note
    ``smoothing``'s region assembly (``dirichlet_system_values`` / ``least_squares_rows`` /
    ``normal_equations_*``) is deliberately *not* merged in here. It looks similar but solves a
    different problem: it **builds** the operator from per-edge weights over a region's own
    pattern, whereas these kernels **extract** the free-free block of an operator that already
    exists. Routing it through here would force an extra full matrix build.

    Solve a small dense symmetric system ``A x = b`` by Householder QR, at any rank.

    Returns ``(solution, ok)``; ``ok`` is False when the system is singular to ``1e-14``, in which
    case the returned vector is ``rhs`` unchanged. Reporting rather than raising, because the caller
    is a kernel: a per-vertex least-squares fit that fails on a degenerate 1-ring has to fall back,
    not abort the launch.

    ``|R[k, k]|`` is the norm of column k after the preceding reflections -- the QR analogue of the
    partial-pivot magnitude a Gaussian elimination would test, to within a ``sqrt(n)`` factor -- so
    a single threshold carries across ranks.

    **The threshold is absolute, so the caller owns the system's scale.** A ``@wp.func`` cannot see
    the units its caller works in, and a relative test is not available either: the normal matrix of
    a polynomial fit is scaled *inhomogeneously* by its design row (``[u^2, u v, v^2, u, v]``
    spreads a mesh scale ``h`` over ``h^8`` to ``h^2`` on the diagonal alone), so
    ``min|R| / max|R|`` moves with ``h`` exactly as ``min|R|`` does. Both callers divide their local
    coordinates by the neighbourhood radius before accumulating, which makes the matrix they hand
    over ``O(1)`` whatever the mesh's units; each says so at the site. A new caller that skips it
    gets a silent ``ok=False`` on a perfectly good system.

    **The rank is nowhere in this function, and that is the point.** It was written twice, as a 5x5
    for ``curvature``'s quadric fit and a 6x6 for ``smoothing``'s area-equalizing solve, because the
    singularity test was a ``for k in range(5)`` / ``range(6)`` loop and a generic matrix has no
    readable rank in kernel scope -- ``r.shape[0]`` is a ``WarpCodegenAttributeError`` at parse time
    on Warp 1.17. ``wp.min(wp.abs(wp.get_diag(r)))`` asks the identical question ("is some
    diagonal below tolerance") with no loop and no rank, which is what let the two collapse into
    one. Verified against ``numpy.linalg.solve`` at both ranks, and the two singularity predicates
    compared directly over hundreds of matrices per rank spanning fourteen orders of conditioning:
    they agree on every finite one, and part only on a matrix carrying a ``nan`` or an ``inf``,
    which the old loop passed (``wp.abs(nan) < tol`` is False, so no iteration rejected it) and this
    reports ``ok=False`` -- the safe direction, and the fallback both callers already take.
