# across threads rather than across the two passes: whenever two distinct query faces genuinely tie
# for the global minimum -- the documented common case, e.g. every face around the vertex realising
# the closest approach -- and both have a tight (corner-touching) AABB against the target, the first
# thread to publish the exact minimum prunes the *other* tied thread's own winning candidate before
# it reaches the leaf test, leaving that thread's ``out_distance_sq`` at ``inf``. The reported
# distance is still correct (the surviving thread found it too), but the documented "``face_a`` is
# the lowest index on a tie" guarantee silently depends on scheduling order. The same relative
# margin the wrapper's seed uses keeps every publication just loose enough that a tied thread's own
# tight bound is never pruned by another thread's, at a prune strength cost too small to measure.

    # supplied ``wp.bvh_query_sphere``; the proof above is the same either way, and the ball is

    # **``candidate_cap`` is what makes this the first of two passes.** The traversal is wildly
    # unbalanced: measured on ``bunny`` against a translated copy, **98.2 %** of query faces have no
    # candidate at all and **0.5 %** carry half of the 2.0 M candidate tests, the busiest walking
    # **3 428** of them alone. So a thread that is still going after ``candidate_cap`` candidates
    # stops, appends its face to ``overflow``, and lets ``face_to_mesh_distance_tiled`` re-walk it
    # with a whole block. Pass a cap of ``INT32_MAX`` to disable the split and settle every face
    # here, which is what the CPU device does -- ``wp.launch_tiled`` runs one lane per block there.
