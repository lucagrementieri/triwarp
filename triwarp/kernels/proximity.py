# thread to publish the exact minimum prunes the *other* tied thread's own winning candidate before
# it reaches the leaf test, leaving that thread's ``out_distance_sq`` at ``inf``. The reported
# distance is still correct (the surviving thread found it too), but the documented "``face_a`` is
# the lowest index on a tie" guarantee silently depends on scheduling order. The same relative
# margin the wrapper's seed uses keeps every publication just loose enough that a tied thread's own
