"""
Kernels for [`triwarp.homology`][triwarp.homology]: one fused tree-cotree pass.

The module builds, in order, a rooted spanning tree of the vertex graph, a spanning **forest** of
the dual graph over the edges that tree left alone, and then traces one loop per leftover edge.
Every stage here is shaped by the same two facts about this call: it is **launch-bound**, and its
only consumer reads ``parents`` and ``distances`` and nothing else.

**The primal tree is a two-kernel level loop, not an order-exact traversal.** A breadth-first
search that has to reproduce ``scipy.sparse.csgraph.breadth_first_order`` spends most of a level
compacting its claims into a FIFO in ``(rank, ascending node id)`` order -- a tiled block scan plus
a serial advance, more than a third of the level's cost against the claim/commit pair that actually
builds the tree. Nothing downstream of a spanning tree reads a discovery order, so the scan is gone
and the level is ``bfs_push_level`` plus a one-thread
[`loop_advance`][triwarp.kernels.array.loop_advance].

**What replaces the order as the tie-break is ``wp.atomic_min`` on the parent**, and it buys two
things beyond the launch. The tree stays deterministic -- ``parents[w]`` is the lowest-indexed
frontier vertex adjacent to ``w``, whatever order the threads ran in -- and the *adjacency* no
longer has to be column-sorted for that to hold, which is what lets the wrapper reach for
[`edges_to_neighbor_lists`][triwarp.graph.edges_to_neighbor_lists] -- a counting pass and a cursor
scatter -- instead of routing 2 * n_edges triplets through ``warp.sparse.bsr_from_triplets``' radix
sort.

``bfs_push_level`` races on ``out_distances`` deliberately: two frontier vertices claiming the same
neighbour both store the same ``level``, so the write is idempotent, and the ``seen == level`` arm
of the visit test is what keeps the second claimer from skipping the ``wp.atomic_min`` it still
has to take part in. Dropping that arm loses the minimum and makes the tree thread-order dependent.

**The dual side is a Boruvka forest, and a forest is all that is needed**: ``homology_generators``
reads the cotree as a *set* -- the generators are the edges in neither tree -- and the loop tracing
walks the **primal** parents. So the dual side has no root and no parent pointers, and its shape is
free to choose. Breadth-first is the one shape that is expensive here: the dual graph restricted to
non-primal-tree edges is *already nearly a tree*, so its diameter is enormous -- on the benchmark
meshes a dual traversal runs several times the primal's level count. Boruvka needs ``O(log F)``
rounds instead. Each round gives every component its minimum-index incident candidate edge, accepts
those edges and unions the components; the union-find core is
[`find_representative`][triwarp.kernels.algorithms.connected_components.find_representative] and
[`ecl_hook_edge`][triwarp.kernels.algorithms.connected_components.ecl_hook_edge], imported rather
than re-derived, so the forest and ``graph.connected_component_labels`` share one implementation of
the pointer-jumping find and of the CAS hook.

**Why the accepted set is a forest.** Edge *indices* are distinct, so "minimum incident index" is a
strict total order on the candidate edges, and the classical Boruvka argument applies: a cycle among
the accepted edges would need a strictly decreasing cycle of minima. The round reads its components
from an immutable ``roots`` snapshot taken before any union, which is what makes that argument exact
here -- deciding against a ``label`` array that other threads are mutating would let one component
accept two edges in a round and could close a cycle.

**Both loops carry their own condition so the wrapper can capture them**, and both do it through
the package's shared round-loop slot table rather than one of their own -- ``array.LOOP_ROUND`` /
``LOOP_CONDITION`` / ``LOOP_PROGRESS``, closed by ``array.loop_advance`` and driven by
``_device.run_device_loop``. A per-round host readback drains the pipeline the round's launches
just filled, and there were about thirty of them across the two loops; the wrapper now synchronizes
three times in the whole call. Each loop passes its own round cap: the merge count and the claim
flag are each a sound termination argument on their own, but a captured loop that fails one hangs
the device rather than returning a wrong answer, so the cap is cheap insurance rather than a
schedule.

**The tracing is two kernels and a scan rather than a Python loop per generator.** Each
generator edge ``(a, b)`` closes into a loop through the tree as ``a -> lca(a, b) -> b``, and its
length is ``depth(a) + depth(b) - 2 * depth(lca) + 1`` -- so ``generator_loop_lengths`` finds the
apex, the wrapper scans the lengths into offsets, and ``write_generator_loops`` fills each loop's
slice from both ends at once. ``distances`` is the depth array the level loop already wrote, which
is why dropping the *order* from the traversal and keeping the *distances* was the right half to
cut: the tracer needs the depths to size a loop without walking it.
