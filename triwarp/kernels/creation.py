    is *unmasked* (it applies to every sample, not only the seam), and all four pole masks are
    snapshots of the post-wrap state, taken before any of them collapses anything.

    The pole anchors need no arguments because they are fixed by the rule itself -- a pole on
    ``j == 0`` or ``i == 0`` collapses to ``(0, 0)``, one on ``j == n_v - 1`` to ``(0, n_v - 1)``,
    one on ``i == n_u - 1`` to ``(n_u - 1, 0)``. A key need not be its own key (a sample on two
