    [`face_normals_and_area`][triwarp.kernels.triangles.face_normals_and_area] states at length:
    this denominator scales as ``h^4``, so an absolute floor of ``TOLERANCE_ZERO_CONSTANT``
    (which this used to carry) rejects *every* corner of a small enough mesh and hands back a
    weight of zero for all of them -- so ``vertex_normals(weighting="mwselr")`` returned an
    all-zero table on a cleanly scaled sphere while ``"area"`` and ``"angle"`` returned correct
    unit normals from the same buffers, and the zero-row contract those callers document covers an
    unreferenced vertex or a cancelling fan, not a clean sphere. ``1 / denom`` is well conditioned
    for any positive ``denom``, so the tolerance was never protecting the division; at
    ``denom == 0`` the corner is exactly degenerate and both branches want zero.

    The remaining range is ``float32``'s, not this test's, and the single test covers both ends:
    ``denom`` underflows to zero below a very short edge, which this branch reads as degenerate,
    and overflows to infinity above a very long one, where ``1 / inf`` is the same zero the other
    branch returns. Position storage is ``float32``, so the small end sits below the scale at which
    the corner coordinates carry any digits at all.

    ``float32`` accumulator it replaced could reach the same answer with a zero-copy

    Generic over the accumulator's precision, and paired with
    ``kernels.scatter.scatter_sum_vec`` / ``scatter_weighted_sum_vec``, which are generic over the

    second copy of either kernel. The three components are carried as scalars rather than assembled
    into a vector because there is no rank-3 vector type to name generically in kernel scope, and
    the length is the same arithmetic either way.
