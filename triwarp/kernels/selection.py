    # faces in input indices (``to_input`` maps a submesh vertex back).
    #
    # That premise -- every consecutive loop pair is a boundary edge of the submesh -- is what
    # ``boundary_loops_batched`` guarantees on *any* input, which is what makes this safe without a
    # check. Its vertex and seam walks run only on a 2-regular rim. Its pinch walk follows
    # ``next_boundary_halfedge``, whose every successor starts where its predecessor ends (twins
    # are true opposites or ``-1``, even unvalidated), and no rotation can enter another boundary
    # halfedge's face (a face is entered through the twin of its incoming halfedge, which a
    # boundary halfedge lacks), so two rotations never merge and ``successor_cycles`` never sees
    # the colliding input that would leave slots at ``0``. What a mesh that is not edge-manifold
    # *can* do is make a loop go missing -- a rotation stopping at a three-faced edge dead-ends
    # -- and a missing loop defeats any classifier equally. ``tests/test_boundary.py`` pins the
    # guarantee on pinched and non-manifold rims. A kept-face count per loop edge would make it
    # checked here too, and measured as costly as the mesh-sized table this replaces.
    #
    # One thread per *loop*, walking its own rim, rather than one per rim vertex with a segment
    # label: boundary loops are few and short, which is the regime
    # ``kernels/array.segment_owner_labels`` names as the one where the per-segment shape wins --
    # and it needs no owner array, no total-terminated offsets and no scan to build them. The
    # early exit is what makes it cheap in the common case, since a loop the deletion opened
    # usually fails on one of its first edges.
