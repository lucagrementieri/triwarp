# Iterative-deepening k-nearest search. A scan at radius ``r`` enumerates every point within
# Euclidean distance ``r``, so a row whose k-th distance is at most ``r`` is provably the exact
# k-NN and the loop can stop. Both accelerators enumerate the ball directly -- the BVH through
# ``wp.bvh_query_sphere`` and the grid through ``wp.hash_grid_query`` -- so the certificate is the
# same statement on both, and neither pays for the bounding cube's extra 6/pi ~ 1.91x of volume.
#
# The loop is a bounded ``for``, never a ``while``: with a NaN query every comparison is false and
# ``r * RADIUS_GROWTH`` stays NaN, which would hang the device. The last attempt is forced to the
# complete radius, which makes termination unconditional and the result exact regardless.
#
# The attempt budget is generous because growth is geometric: the doublings before the successful
# scan sum to less than that scan costs, so a spare attempt is nearly free — whereas running *out*
# of attempts forces the complete scan, which is the whole-cloud brute force this change exists to
# avoid. 16 doublings cover a query 3 x 10^4 spacings away from the cloud.

# Candidate-row sizes the register-resident k-NN kernels are generated for. The row is held in a
# ``wp.types.vector(length=K)`` value type, i.e. in registers, so ``K`` must be a compile-time
# constant and one kernel exists per bucket. A query takes the smallest bucket that fits its ``k``,
# keeps the ``K`` nearest (a superset of the ``k`` nearest) and writes out only the first ``k``
# slots; a ``k`` past the largest bucket falls back to the global-memory row kernels.
#
# The register row beats the global-memory one at every bucket, by more the wider the row.
# **64 is the last bucket because that is where the curve turns, not because the gain runs out**: a
# row costs ``2 * K`` registers, and ``wp.get_cuda_kernel_properties`` reports the six shipped
# buckets at 42-222 registers with ``local_memory_size`` **0** at every one, so nothing shipped
# spills. A 96-wide row extrapolates past the 255-register-per-thread hardware limit and must
# spill, which drops it back below the k=64 gain -- the bucket list ends where the register file
# does, not at an arbitrary cut, and no in-repo caller asks for more.
#
# **``cuda_max_registers`` does not move that wall, and it was measured rather than assumed.**
# Capping below a kernel's natural register count does not make it leaner, it makes it *spill*:
# rebuilt under every cap, the shipped buckets report non-zero ``local_memory_size`` and run
# several times slower, with results identical. That is also the answer to the 96-bucket question
# above. The buckets stay uncapped.
#
# The buckets are not free: they cost ``2 x len(KNN_ROW_BUCKETS)`` generated kernels, which roughly
# triples this module's cold-cache compile (once per Warp version and arch) and doubles its warm
# per-process load.

#
# ``@wp.func`` calls inline at codegen, so this is free -- confirmed rather than assumed, with
# ``wp.get_cuda_kernel_properties`` reporting identical register counts and zero local memory
# across the extraction. And the move is *provably* behaviour-neutral where a float32 extraction
# would not be (CLAUDE.md section 2.4 warns that a green suite is not evidence): neither shared run

# Register-row k-NN kernel factories.
#
# ``query_bvh_nearest_neighbors`` above keeps its candidate row in the *output* arrays, so every
# accepted candidate pays a binary search plus two shift passes over global memory and the row is
# re-zeroed on every deepening attempt: at a wide ``k`` the row, not the geometry, is the call.
# Holding it in a ``wp.types.vector(length=K)`` puts it in registers, which is why these kernels
# exist and why ``K`` must be a compile-time constant. A ``wp.zeros(shape=K)`` stack array is a
# **2x loss** instead, because nothing promotes it to registers (CLAUDE.md section 2.9).
#
# Everything the row touches **once per query or per attempt** is factored into the generated
# ``@wp.func`` set below. The **per-candidate insert alone stays inline**, three times, and the
# split is measured: passing the row to a ``wp.ref`` helper is a large loss on **CPU** at the wide
# buckets, passing it by value a far larger loss on **CUDA**, and the once-per-attempt helpers are
# flat on both. Do not "finish" this dedup by moving the insert too.
#
# The contract the copies must hold is the *distance* row, not the tie-break. ``placed`` is **not**
# load-bearing: without it the carry skips a slot holding an equal distance and displaces further
# down, which permutes *which* of several equidistant points fills a slot and leaves every distance
# bit-identical — and ``query_nearest``'s docstring declares a tied neighbour's identity
# unspecified.
#
# So the guard on an edit here is a *tied* fixture, not a second implementation to diff against:
# ``tests/test_neighbors.py::test_query_nearest_ties`` runs every ``KNN_ROW_BUCKETS`` size against
# ``scipy.spatial.KDTree`` on an integer lattice, where a query has dozens of exactly tied
# neighbours. Verified live: shortening the shift chain by one slot fails every case.
