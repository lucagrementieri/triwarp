"""
Blue-noise surface sampling: maximal Poisson-disk selection from a dense pool.

**Randomized-priority parallel dart throwing.** Every pool point draws a priority from the seed; a
point is accepted when no *smaller-priority* point still in play sits within ``r`` of it; everything
within ``r`` of an accepted point is then discarded. Iterate until the pool is empty.

Three properties fall out of that, and they are why this replaced the Bridson active-list walk this
module used to hold:

- **The minimum distance is exact, not approximate.** Two accepted points cannot be within ``r`` of
  each other: within one round the larger-priority one of the pair would have seen the smaller and
  declined, and across rounds the later one would already have been discarded by the earlier one's
  ``r``-ball.
- **The result is maximal**, so the uncovered gap is bounded: a survivor is by definition a point no
  accepted point covers, so the loop cannot stop while an ``r``-gap remains. The measured worst gap
  is *tighter* than MeshLab's hierarchical dart throwing and Open3D's sample elimination at the same
  parameter.
- **It is the serial algorithm's distribution.** Accepting local priority minima and discarding
  their balls, repeatedly, visits the pool in exactly priority order, so the output is what
  sequential dart throwing over a uniformly random order gives -- parallel, not approximate.
  And because each pass writes only its own thread's slot and reads only states it cannot itself
  change, a round is a deterministic function of its input state: same seed, same samples.

The round count is what makes it fast. The smallest-priority point still in play is always a local
minimum, so every round accepts something, and each acceptance discards a whole ``r``-ball -- which
empties the pool in a handful of rounds where an active-list walk needed a hundred or so, for a
several-fold end-to-end win at a slightly higher sample count.

Background grid cells are ``r`` on a side, so a ``3x3x3`` neighbourhood contains every point within
``r`` and both sweeps are 27 cells. Bridson's, by contrast, had to enumerate a ``9x9x9`` shell per
active parent per round to find its ``[r, 2r]`` annulus -- 729 cells against 27, which together with
the round count is the whole difference.

**Most of those 27 cells cannot affect the answer, and one word per cell says which.** Each sweep
vetoes a candidate on a single property of the points in a neighbouring cell -- an acceptance for
the covering sweep, a smaller priority for the selection sweep -- so a per-cell summary of that
property decides the whole cell without loading a point from it. Two summaries are rebuilt per
round, at a cost of two fills and one atomic pass over the work list (after the first round that
pass rides on the previous round's compaction); they remove work whose outcome
was already determined, so the accepted set is identical by construction rather than by tolerance,
and together they are worth roughly 2x.

**And those summaries are why the obvious next step is not one.** The membership lists are built
once over the whole pool and never compacted, so as rounds retire points the sweeps walk lists that
are mostly dead -- entries scanned exceed live ones severalfold. Compacting the covered entries out
is provably answer-preserving (the selection sweep skips a ``DART_COVERED`` vetoer explicitly and
the covering sweep only ever matches ``DART_ACCEPTED``, so the dropped entries are exactly the ones
both already walked past) and it was built, byte-gated and **refuted** as a small loss.

The reason is the summaries above, and it is worth stating because the dead-entry ratio looks
compelling on its own. A per-cell summary skips a cell *without loading a point from it*, so the
inner loop only ever runs on cells that genuinely hold a smaller-priority alive point or a fresh
acceptance -- and those cells are mostly live, so there is little dead weight left to remove. The
device time barely moves and the compaction's own launches and readbacks are the whole loss.
Occupancy stopped being the cost when the summaries landed; do not re-derive this from the alive
counts.
