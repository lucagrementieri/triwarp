"""
Per-source breadth-first collection over a CSR adjacency graph.

``per_source_bfs_collect`` — one thread per source over caller-provided global-memory scratch rows
(a FIFO queue whose emitted prefix is the discovery order, an open-addressing visited hash set, and
a small nearest-fallback pool). With a finite ``radius`` it enqueues only neighbors within
``radius`` of the center (and backfills the nearest out-of-ball vertices up to ``min_count``) — the
geodesic-ball query behind [`triwarp.neighbors.geodesic_ball`][triwarp.neighbors.geodesic_ball].
Its nearest-fallback pool scans with the shared ``wp.ref`` argmin/argmax helpers, so any kernel
calling it must be decorated ``@wp.kernel(enable_backward=False)`` (see ``triwarp.kernels.array``).

**This module used to carry two whole-graph engines besides**: a level-synchronous frontier loop
that reproduced ``scipy.sparse.csgraph.breadth_first_order``'s FIFO order without a sort, and a
one-thread serial drain it handed off to once the frontier went narrow. Both existed for a public
``graph.bfs``, whose only in-tree consumer was the homology decomposition — which reads a spanning
tree's ``parents`` and depths and never a discovery order. Reproducing scipy's order cost a tiled
block scan and a serial advance per level, 9.9 us of a 26.1 us level, so the decomposition now
carries its own two-kernel level loop in ``triwarp.kernels.homology`` and the order-exact engines
are gone. Anything needing scipy's exact visit order should call scipy.

    BFS over the CSR edge graph from source ``i``; returns the collected count.

    Traverses ``adj_offsets``/``adj_columns`` with a FIFO ``queue`` and an O(1) open-addressing
    ``visited`` hash row — power-of-two length, pre-filled with ``-1`` by the caller before the
    launch. When ``radius`` is finite the traversal is *geodesic* (libigl ``getSphere``): a
    neighbor is enqueued only when within Euclidean ``radius`` of the center, and out-of-ball
    neighbors feed a nearest fallback (``ext_dist``/``ext_idx``) drained to ``min_count``. When
    ``radius`` is ``+inf`` the geometric predicate is disabled (``vertices`` is never read, so a
    length-1 placeholder is fine); pass ``min_count = 0`` so the fallback never engages.

    On return the collected set *is* ``queue[:count]`` in BFS-then-backfill order (drained
    fallback candidates are appended to the queue), so ``count == q_tail <= queue capacity``
    always and the caller gathers results straight from its queue row — no second traversal.
    Exceeding the queue or visited capacity increments ``out_overflow`` and drops the surplus.
