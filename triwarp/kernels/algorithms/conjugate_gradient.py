"""
Batched Jacobi-preconditioned conjugate gradient over the columns of one operator.

Drives every multi-column SPD solve in ``triwarp/linalg.py`` -- ``harmonic`` / ``tutte`` /
``arap``'s global step, the implicit smoothers, the signed heat solve -- in place of
``warp.optim.linear.cg``'s iteration. It exists for one measured reason: ``replicated_operator``
attaches ``batch_offsets`` so the solve converges on its worst column, and that is exactly the input
for which Warp's ``TiledDot`` takes its **direct batched** reduction, one block per (column,
subproblem). Every lane of that one block then reduces ``n / tile_size`` entries serially, so the
dot costs *O(n)* where the unbatched tiled tree is flat -- and two dots run per iteration, which
made them roughly half of an iteration at a typical system size.

The reduction here is a real two-stage tree that stays per column, so the batching is kept and the
cost is not. The iteration is the Chronopoulos-Gear form (1989): the same iterates as CG in exact
arithmetic, with ``alpha`` recovered from ``r.u`` and ``w.u`` (``u = M^-1 r``, ``w = A u``) and
``s = A p`` carried by recurrence, so a round is one mat-vec that reduces all three of its dots
(``cg_matvec_dots``) and one update (``cg_update``) -- two launches, against standard CG's
mat-vec, ``p.Ap``, update and ``r.z`` with a finalize after each reduction. The Jacobi apply rides
in the update's register, and each block of the update folds the reductions' second stage itself.
Measured against the six-launch standard iteration on the same systems: a round costs ~13 us
against ~17 us replayed, the conditional-graph test being the largest single part of what is left,
with iteration counts equal or within a few rounds on the systems the suite and benchmarks solve.

**A block conjugate gradient (O'Leary 1980) sharing one Krylov subspace across exactly two columns
lived here and was removed.** It advanced both columns against one shared subspace, the scalar
``alpha`` / ``beta`` becoming 2x2 dense matrices solved fresh every iteration. It does cut the
iteration count on a uniform mesh, but its iteration costs more launches than this one's and on
an ill-conditioned system the count goes the other way -- see ``_cg_columns`` in
``triwarp/linalg.py`` for the measurement that retired it.

    # whose own scaling launch this replaces, and the polynomial then writes ``u``. A V-cycle writes
    # ``u`` in its own launches with ``jacobi`` unset. Only the ``n`` live rows are written, so

    # ``(0, 0)`` closes the round (``cg_close_round``). Without it ``cg_coefficients`` has done all
