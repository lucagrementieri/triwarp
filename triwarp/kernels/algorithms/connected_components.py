"""
ECL-CC connected components (init + single-pass CAS hook + pointer-jumping flatten).

Two variants over the same union-find core:

- the plain one (``ecl_init_parent`` / ``ecl_hook`` / ``ecl_flatten``) labels components from a CSR
  adjacency, one thread per node with the row's representative hoisted across it -- or, through
  ``ecl_hook_edges``, straight from an edge list, one thread per edge, with no CSR to build;
- the **parity** one (``ecl_init_parent_parity`` / ``ecl_hook_parity`` / ``ecl_flatten_parity``)
  carries a Z2 potential alongside the labelling, from a signed edge list, one thread per edge.
  See ``find_representative_parity`` for the packing that makes it work.
