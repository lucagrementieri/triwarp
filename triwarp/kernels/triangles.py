    it is worse at every triangle shape and scale and better at none.** Its two terms agree to more
    digits as the corner angle closes, so the subtraction loses them.

    Measured against a ``float128`` oracle, 200 random interior points per cell, over base scales
    ``1e-3`` / ``1`` / ``1e3`` crossed with unit-base triangle heights ``1`` down to ``1e-5`` --
    worst absolute coordinate error, flat in the scale:

    | 1e-5 | 9.8e-08 | ``nan`` in 200 of 200 |

    This form sits at ``float32`` eps in all 21 cells; Cramer degrades monotonically and, at
    ``1e-4``, returns values that are *finite and wholly wrong*, which is worse than the ``nan``
    below it because nothing downstream can detect it. The breakdown is not a ``float32`` artifact
    -- the same sweep shows ``float128`` Cramer departing from the exact answer by 1.9e-10 at

    0.0267 at 200 000.

    Zero area -- a triangle that really is a segment or a point, not merely a thin one -- is

# Concrete overloads, registered at import -- rationale in ``triwarp/kernels/reduce.py``, rule in
# CLAUDE.md section 2.5. One generic kernel, but measured at **5** module loads over the suite, and
# this module backs 15 kernel modules and 2 wrappers, so each rebuild is widely felt.
#
# The vertex precision and the volume precision move together: ``face_signed_volumes`` reads a
# ``wp.vec3`` cloud into ``wp.float32`` volumes or a ``wp.vec3d`` one into ``wp.float64``, never a
# mixture, because the wrapper derives the output dtype from the vertex dtype.
# The concrete handle keyed by the vertex dtype -- see
# [`OverloadTable`][triwarp.kernels.array.OverloadTable]. This kernel is the tree's clearest case:
# it is generic in *three* parameters (the vertex array, the apex vector and the output scalar), and
# resolution cost scales with that count. Measured on an RTX 5090, Warp 1.17, 100 launches between
# two synchronization points at 81 920 faces: **26.6 us generic against 12.2 us through the handle,
# 2.17x**, output bit-identical.
