    # area-weighted centroid contribution, the block reduces each component cooperatively with
    # wp.tile_sum, and lane 0 commits four atomics per block (out-of-range lanes contribute zero).
    # CPU MUST NOT use this: the lanes partition the **outer** work (the face list), so the stride
    # is the constant `TILE_1D` and not `wp.block_dim()` -- and `wp.launch_tiled` runs one lane per
    # block on the CPU device through Warp 1.17, where that lane would see one face per tile. This
    # is the constant-stride case of the rule in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` section 2.2, and it is why this
    # reduction keeps a device pair where `kernels/visibility.py::obscurance` needs only one
    # kernel. See `centroid_sliced` and `_device.prefers_tiled_reduction`.
    #
    # **Rewriting it into the lane-strided `ITEMS_PER_BLOCK_1D` fold was measured and declined**,
    # and the reason is worth keeping, because the same rewrite is worth several-fold on the
    # `registration` and `points` accumulators (`.claude/CLAUDE.md` section 13.2). Built as
    # `tile_chunk(n_faces, chunk, ITEMS_PER_BLOCK_1D)` plus a `wp.block_dim()` stride -- which would
    # also make it portable and retire `centroid_sliced` -- it measures flat at every mesh size. The
    # fold pays on *atomic contention*, and contention here is `blocks x slots`: four slots is an
    # order of magnitude short of the accumulators that won, which carry twenty-five and
    # forty-three. Below that the launch floor hides it. With no CUDA win to pay for it the
    # portability is not free either -- `blocks_1d(n)` would give the CPU path far fewer,
    # single-lane blocks than `slice_count`'s threads -- so the device pair stays.
    #
    # One ``(4,)`` accumulator rather than a ``(3,)`` and a ``(1,)``: slots 0-2 are the
    # area-weighted centroid sum and slot 3 the area sum. The wrapper's return is a host-side
    # ``wp.vec3``, so both have to cross the bus -- and a readback's cost is almost all fixed, so
    # one read of four floats beats two reads of three and one. ``centroid_sliced`` writes the
    # same four slots. Measured 1.75x on ``surface_centroid``, which also loses an allocation and
    # a launch argument.
    #
    # The per-face contribution is ``triangles.face_area_weighted_centroid``, shared with
    # ``centroid_sliced`` below so the two paths cannot drift; see it for why the area is taken
    # from the corners this kernel already holds.
