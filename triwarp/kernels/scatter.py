    # ``out_sum.dtype(...)`` is the conversion, and it is required rather than cosmetic: Warp does
    # **not** promote a float32 value into a float64 accumulator, and ``wp.atomic_add`` with the
    # two mismatched fails at kernel-parse time (probed on Warp 1.17). Reading the array's dtype
    # in kernel scope costs nothing -- unlike ``type(out_sum[row, 0])(...)``, the other spelling
    # that works, which loads the element it is about to update just to name its type.
    #
    # **Every caller today accumulates at float64 while its values are float32, and that is what
    # makes the sum reproducible.** A float atomic's summation order is whatever the scheduler
    # hands it, and float addition is not associative, so a float32 accumulator moves by about a
    # ULP between runs of the identical launch. That is harmless in itself and not harmless
    # downstream: ``curvature.principal_curvature`` fits an ill-conditioned quadric to these normals
    # and turns it into swings of most of the returned curvature at near-flat vertices. Widening the
    # accumulator does not fix the ordering -- nothing here can -- but it drops the disagreement
    # between two orderings far below what the float32 result can represent, so the narrowed answer
    # is reproducible in practice. It is not a *guarantee*: a sum landing within an eps of a float32
    # rounding boundary could still round both ways.
    #
    # Cost: the scatter kernel itself is within noise of the float32 one, and
    # ``vertices.vertex_normals`` end to end wins on a small mesh -- the fused narrow-and-normalize
    # tail removes a launch, since a float32 accumulator could reach ``wp.vec3`` through a zero-copy
    # ``array_cast`` and a float64 one cannot -- and loses slightly on a large one, where the wider
