"""
Kernels for the three heat-diffusion solvers of [`triwarp.heat`][triwarp.heat].

Everything runs in ``float64``: far from the source the diffused field decays exponentially and
would underflow ``float32``, destroying the gradient direction and collapsing the far field. The
per-face half-cotangent weights are reused from ``triwarp.laplacian`` (they are ``O(1)`` and
numerically safe in ``float32``); only the assembled operators, the diffused field and the linear
solves need double precision.

Three sections, in the order their wrappers appear: the scalar heat method's diffusion and gradient
normalization, the signed method's curve seeding and level-set constraints, and the vector method's
transport, extension and log map. They share `face_unit_gradient`, `tangent_to_world` and the
``float64`` convention, which is why they are one module rather than three.
