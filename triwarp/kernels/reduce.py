    ``n / (TILE_1D * TILES_PER_BLOCK_1D)`` and **not** ``n / TILE_1D``. Call this rather than
    open-coding the division: passing the tile count would give each block the same 16 tiles the
    next 15 blocks also claim, folding every element 16 times over -- and, the fold being
    idempotent for the extrema, that would leave ``min`` / ``max`` / ``any`` / ``all`` looking
    correct while ``sum`` silently returned 16x its answer.

    Parameters
    ----------

# Boolean reductions over int32 0/1 masks. ``any`` == OR == max; ``all`` == AND

# is handled by the wrapper flattening the mask and reusing the 1-D kernel, so no
# ``*2d_tiled`` bool kernel is needed.
#
# These reach a kernel only through ``reduce._reduce_bool``, which casts the mask to a 0/1
# ``wp.int32`` first -- and ``wp.bool`` is not a ``wp.Scalar`` anyway -- so each is a single
# concrete kernel rather than a dtype table.

    axis=None over a ``wp.bool`` mask, read as bytes instead of through an ``int32`` copy.

    ``wp.Scalar`` does not instantiate for ``wp.bool`` (CLAUDE.md section 12.4), so the factories
    above cannot serve a mask and the wrapper used to widen one with ``array.astype`` first: an
    allocation of ``4n`` bytes, a launch, a full read of ``n`` and a full write of ``4n``, after
    which the reduction read ``4n`` rather than ``n`` -- nine bytes of traffic per mask byte, plus
    a launch and an allocation, to answer one boolean. This reads the mask directly.

    **The shape differs from ``_reduce_1d_tiled``'s and the difference is forced.** There is no
    ``wp.tile_load`` of a ``bool`` array, so the block's chunk is walked by the lanes rather than
    loaded as tiles: each lane strides by ``wp.block_dim()`` -- never by ``TILE_1D``, which is what
    keeps it correct on the CPU device, where ``wp.launch_tiled`` runs one lane per block and
    ``wp.block_dim()`` reads 1 (section 2.2) -- accumulates in a register, and the block folds the
    per-lane values with a single ``wp.tile`` reduction. That is one tile reduction per block where
    the tile-load form runs ``TILES_PER_BLOCK_1D`` of them, and the strided reads are coalesced
    (consecutive lanes, consecutive bytes).

    ``identity`` seeds a lane that draws no element: ``0`` for ``sum`` and ``any``, ``1`` for
    ``all``. The tile-load factory seeds from the block's first chunk instead and so needs none,
    which it cannot do here because a lane may legitimately have nothing.

# The "componentwise ``wp.tile_sum`` reductions, then one lane-0-guarded atomic commit" skeleton
# that reads ``tile_chunk``/``outer_sum_chunk``'s partial sums out is itself hand-written at seven
# call sites with no shared helper: ``points.centered_covariance`` (9 scalars, above),
# ``points.accumulate_counted_mean`` (2), ``measures.moment_integrals`` (10),
# ``registration.accumulate_procrustes_moments`` (25), ``accumulate_point_to_plane`` (43),
# ``homology.count_reached_and_referenced`` (2) and ``homology.dual_candidate_mask`` (1).
#
# Deliberately unmerged. Each loop is over a different fixed component count with no common shape
# cheap to generalize over -- Warp has no variadic tile reduction, so a shared helper would have to
# take an arbitrary tuple of scalar/vector/matrix quantities -- and the *bodies* differ in more than
# the count: ``moment_integrals`` needs its chunk width as a launch argument because its
# per-element arithmetic is heavy enough to have a real occupancy crossover, and
# ``homology.dual_candidate_mask`` takes ``TILE_1D`` rather than ``ITEMS_PER_BLOCK_1D`` because it
# *also* writes one mask entry per element, so the wide fold would throw its per-element dimension
# away. A helper general over both would be more speculative machinery than the call sites justify
# (CLAUDE.md section 4.2). What *is* shared is already factored: ``tile_chunk`` and the clamp rule
# it documents, which is the part that goes wrong.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Concrete overloads, registered at import.
#
# Every kernel above annotated ``wp.Scalar`` would be *generic*, and Warp instantiates an overload
# lazily, on the first launch at each new dtype — which changes the module hash and recompiles
# every kernel in this file. Registering every (kernel, dtype) pair the wrapper's dispatch can
# reach gives the module one hash for its whole lifetime. Registration is not compilation, so it
# costs milliseconds of import and nothing on a process that never reduces anything (CLAUDE.md
# section 2.5).
#
# The trade is honest about one thing: the *single* compile is bigger, since the module holds ~110
# concrete kernels rather than the ~40 a lazy fork built. That is the cost of editing this file,
# not of using it, and it is cached. If it ever becomes the bottleneck, the escape is
# ``@wp.kernel(module="unique")`` per generated kernel, the way ``warp.sparse`` does, so a rebuild
# touches one kernel instead of all of them.
#
# Two rules for keeping it that way:
#
# - **A new generic kernel here must be added to a group below, and a new dtype to the right
#   tuple.** ``test_generic_kernels_register_their_overloads`` catches the first; nothing catches
#   the second, because a missing dtype does not fail — it re-forks the chain on its first launch.
#   The symptom is a test or a script that suddenly takes tens of seconds; read it as a rebuild
#   (CLAUDE.md section 15.1).
# - **The dtype set is the one ``triwarp.reduce`` dispatches over**, not every dtype ``wp.Scalar``
#   admits: an unused overload is compile time paid on every rebuild. The boolean reductions are
#   ``wp.int32`` only because ``_reduce_bool`` converts the mask first, and ``wp.bool`` is not a
#   ``wp.Scalar`` in any case.
#
# ``block_dim`` forks the hash independently and is deliberately left forked. It is not the same
# pathology: the values in use are fixed by *this package's* launch code — ``TILE_1D`` for the
# ``wp.launch_tiled`` reductions, Warp's 256 default for the plain ones, 1 on CPU — so they are a
# bounded set, not a chain whose length grows with what a caller reduces first. Collapsing them by
# passing ``block_dim=TILE_1D`` at the plain-launch sites was measured and declined: a substantial
# loss on the per-axis reductions and nothing at scale.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Nothing in this module is generic any more, so there is no ``_register_overloads`` here: every
# kernel above is a concrete factory instantiation, which is what a registered overload *is*. The
# rule in CLAUDE.md section 2.5 is unchanged and still binds every other kernel module -- what
# changed is that the tables now hand the wrapper the concrete kernel instead of making
# ``wp.launch`` re-derive it (see the note above ``MIN1D_TILED``).


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Fused all-close reduction.
#
# ``array.allclose`` ran a ``wp.map`` of the element predicate into an ``(n,)`` mask and then a
# whole ``reduce.all`` over it -- two launches, two allocations, the map's own host-side resolution
# and a reduction that reads back what the predicate pass already knew. The answer is one boolean,
# so the predicate folds into its own reduction: one launch, one four-byte accumulator, one
# readback.
#
# **A table of concrete kernels rather than one generic one**, for ``_reduce_1d_tiled``'s reason
# (CLAUDE.md section 2.7): a generic kernel pays host-side overload resolution on every launch,
# which on a call this small is most of what the fusion just saved. Registered over exactly the
# dtypes ``allclose``'s own signature admits -- ``float16`` / ``float32`` / ``float64`` and
# ``wp.vec3`` -- which is section 2.5's rule, not every dtype the template would accept.
#
# The fold is ``wp.min`` over a per-lane 0/1, so "all close" is "the block minimum is 1"; lanes with
# no element seed 1 (the identity), and the commit is one ``wp.atomic_min`` per block.
