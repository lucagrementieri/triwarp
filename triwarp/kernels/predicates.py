"""
Precision-generic geometric predicates and the small triangle quantities they share.

These are the standard triangle quantities -- double area, circumcircle and minimum-enclosing-
circle diameters, aspect ratio, dihedral angle -- and they were duplicated three times before this
module existed: a ``float32`` set in ``kernels/reconstruction.py``, a byte-equivalent ``float64``
set in ``kernels/remesh.py``, and a third partial copy in ``kernels/holes.py``. Each
`@wp.func` here is generic over the scalar type, so one definition instantiates at whatever
precision the calling kernel uses.

The later arrivals are the same defect one level out: ``triangle_aabb`` came from
``kernels/intersection.py`` and ``triangle_double_area`` / ``circumcircle_diameter`` from
``kernels/holes.py``, where a general triangle quantity had ended up inside a module that owns an
*algorithm* and other modules were importing the algorithm to reach the geometry.
``point_plane_dot`` and ``triangle_aabb_overlap`` (with its ``axis_interval_projection`` /
``unit_axis`` / ``plane_box_overlap`` / ``edge_axes_separate`` helpers) followed from the same
place and for the same reason: they were the last two edges of the whole ``kernels/`` import graph
running from an algorithm module to a geometric predicate, with ``kernels/points.py`` and
``kernels/voxels.py`` importing the mesh-slicing algorithm to reach a plane dot and a
separating-axis test.

Degenerate inputs return [`float_inf`][triwarp.kernels.predicates.float_inf] — an actual infinity,
so callers detect the case with ``wp.isinf`` rather than by comparing against a magic large value.

!!! note
    Vector parameters are annotated ``Any`` rather than a concrete ``wp.vec3`` / ``wp.vec3d``:
    Warp has no generic vector annotation, and ``Any`` lets the kernel's own vector type flow
    through. Scalars use ``wp.Float``. Literals inside these functions must be built with
    ``type(x)(...)`` so they instantiate at the caller's precision.

    # 50 000 pairs -- and the faster one was answering a different question. The cost is the
    # data-dependent edge loop in ``plane_crossing_span``, where SAT is straight-line arithmetic.
    # **The arithmetic is float64 on float32 inputs**, and that is the load-bearing choice here.
    # Widening a float32 is lossless, so this is the same geometry; what the extra precision buys is

    # It costs **2.1x on this kernel** (48 against 22 us at ~52k candidate pairs, measured
    # interleaved on three self-intersecting surfaces) and **~4 % end to end**, because the narrow
    # phase is only 6-8 % of ``face_self_intersecting_mask``'s wall clock -- the BVH build, the
