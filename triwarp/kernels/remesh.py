# barrier. The sequence, with the grid barrier each boundary stands for:
#
#   begin_decimation_pass -> sort corner keys -> mark_unique_edge_starts -> scan ->
#   emit_pass_edges -> count_pass_edges -> scan -> scatter_pass_adjacency ->
#   quadric_collapse_candidates -> sort costs -> drop_past_half ->

#    end_collapse_round]* -> remap_and_mark_faces -> scan -> compact_decimation_pass
#
# **The per-pass adjacency is one buffer.** The vertex-vertex CSR and the vertex-face CSR are both
# "count per vertex, scan, scatter", so their counts sit side by side in one array (vertex-vertex
# rows first, then vertex-face rows at ``vertex_capacity``) and one exclusive scan yields both
# offset tables and the two payloads' positions in one shared buffer. Neither CSR's row order is
# sorted -- a row is filled in atomic arrival order -- and nothing reads it in order: the link
# condition counts, the lock and the claim take unions and minima, and the flip veto is an any.
