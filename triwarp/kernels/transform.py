"""
Affine transform primitives: the three point/vector/normal maps and the device-matrix launcher.

The three `wp.func`s here are `wp.map` targets rather than kernels (CLAUDE.md section 3.5), so the
public wrappers in [`triwarp.transform`][triwarp.transform] carry the allocation and the in-place
``out=`` contract. `apply_transform_mat44` stays a kernel because its matrix lives in a *device*
array: `wp.map` broadcasts a uniform, and reading a fitted transform back to the host just to
apply it would cost the readback [`triwarp.registration`][triwarp.registration] exists to avoid.
