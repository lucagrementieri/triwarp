"""
Generative sampling: new points on a mesh surface, inside its volume, or over a sphere.

Everything here *creates* points -- uniformly over the faces
([`sample_surface`][triwarp.sample.sample_surface]), spaced at least ``radius`` apart
([`sample_surface_poisson_disk`][triwarp.sample.sample_surface_poisson_disk],
[`sample_surface_blue_noise`][triwarp.sample.sample_surface_blue_noise]), inside a watertight solid
([`sample_volume`][triwarp.sample.sample_volume]), or over a sphere, hemisphere or cone as a
low-discrepancy Fibonacci lattice (the ``sample_fibonacci_*`` family, which take a count and no
mesh at all).

*Subsampling* an existing cloud is the other question and lives with the data structures that
answer it: [`points.farthest_point_sample`][triwarp.points.farthest_point_sample] for an exact
count, and [`voxels.voxel_down_sample`][triwarp.voxels.voxel_down_sample] for one representative
per occupied cell. Neither belongs here -- each is a reduction of points a caller already has.

The one function here that reads like a subsampler and is not is
[`sample_surface_blue_noise`][triwarp.sample.sample_surface_blue_noise]: it draws its own dense pool
from the surface and thins *that*, so its input is a mesh and its output is new points, never a
subset of anything the caller passed.

    Generate near-uniform unit vectors on the sphere via the Fibonacci spiral.

    Mark the ``excess`` heaviest flagged points, so a round deletes exactly enough.

    Two rounds need it and neither is an ordinary one: the last, where the local maxima outnumber
    what is left to delete, and a round in which *no* point is a local maximum because every alive
    point is isolated -- there ``candidates`` is the alive set rather than the maxima. Every other
    round deletes all of its maxima and never calls this.

    It used to read the flags and ``weights`` back in full and pick the top ``excess`` with
    ``numpy.argsort``, moving ``2 * init_count`` elements across the bus where the rest of the loop
    moves none. Sorting the flagged weights on the device removes both readbacks and the upload.

    Ties order differently from ``numpy.argsort``'s quicksort -- ``radix_sort_pairs`` is stable --
    and exact ties are common rather than rare: ``_poisson_edge_weight`` clamps any distance below
    ``r_min`` up to it, so a point whose neighbours are all closer than that carries exactly its
    neighbour count times one constant. Which of two equally-crowded points is dropped is not a

    Sample points on a triangle mesh surface with a blue-noise (Poisson-disk) distribution.

    Draws a dense uniform surface pool — ``30x`` the expected output, the oversampling factor

    within ``radius`` of each other, by randomized-priority parallel dart throwing. The result has
    the distribution of sequential dart throwing over a uniformly random order of the pool; see
    ``kernels/algorithms/blue_noise.py`` for why the parallelism costs nothing in distribution, and

    Parameters
    ----------

        Vertex positions.
    faces
        Flat triangle indices ``(i0, i1, i2)`` per face.
    radius
        Minimum Poisson disk radius (Euclidean distance in 3D). Enforced exactly: the closest pair

    seed
        RNG seed for the initial uniform sampling and the sampling order. If ``None``, a random seed

    Returns
    -------
    samples

    The count is **derived**, never requested: it is what a maximal ``radius``-packing of the

    Maximal Poisson-disk subset of ``pool_points`` by randomized-priority parallel dart throwing.

    See ``kernels/algorithms/blue_noise.py`` for why the result has the same distribution as one
    pass of the serial algorithm. The loop is a handful of rounds over a shrinking work list;
    the one host readback per round is the survivor count, which is also the termination test.

    **The round count is stable, and it is not where the cost is.** Measured on five mesh shapes
    (icosphere at two resolutions, torus, cylinder, box) across a 55x range of pool sizes, 12 633
    to 692 820, and output sizes 229 to 12 684: **4 to 6 rounds**, every time, growing
    logarithmically with the pool as randomized-priority maximal-independent-set theory predicts,
    and the pool-to-output ratio holding at 54-57. An earlier reading that the round count varies
    several-fold between clouds does not reproduce. What a round actually costs, from
    ``wp.timing_begin`` (nothing here graph-captures, so the split is trustworthy): 48 % device at
    the small end and 69 % at the large one, and of the device half, 87-92 % is two kernels --
    ``dart_select_minima`` and ``dart_cover_neighbors``, the shell scans themselves. Those two are
    where any further win has to come from; the loop structure around them is already near its
    launch floor.

    Sample points uniformly inside a watertight triangle mesh volume.

    Fans tetrahedra from the mesh's area-weighted surface centroid, builds a CDF
    from signed tetrahedron volumes, and draws uniform points inside each selected one via
    the order-statistics barycentric method (zero rejection for meshes that are
    star-shaped with respect to their centroid).
