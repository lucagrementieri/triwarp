"""
Benchmark mesh registries: the real scan meshes and the synthetic feature meshes.

Two registries, for two different questions.

``MESHES`` holds the scan meshes read from ``benchmarks/data/``. They are indexed by triangle
count and answer "how does this scale with ``N``", which is the whole story only for the
throughput functions — per-face passes, reductions, edge sorts.

``FEATURE_MESHES`` answers every other question. Cost in this package is far more often driven by
something that a face count cannot express: how many connected components there are, how many
boundary loops and how long, the diameter of the adjacency graph, triangle aspect ratio, vertex
valence. So the feature registry is built around a single **control** mesh, ``sphere_med``
(``icosphere(6)``: 40 962 vertices, 81 920 faces, one watertight component, uniform valence 6,
graph diameter ~130, no boundary, aspect ratio ~1.4), and a set of meshes that each perturb
*exactly one* of those properties while pinning ``V`` and/or ``F`` to the control. A group's
timing spread then attributes to a named cause rather than to "a different mesh".

``AXES`` names the resulting comparisons and is what ``@pytest.mark.benchaxis`` selects. The
control comes first in each tuple, so a results table reads left-to-right as "baseline, then the
perturbation".

Meshes are built with ``trimesh.creation``, never with ``triwarp.creation``: a benchmark input
must not depend on the code under test, and ``conftest._load_numpy`` exists so that trimesh, igl,
open3d and warp all receive one shared NumPy source. ``triwarp.creation`` is the *subject* of
``test_creation``, never the supplier of another module's input.
