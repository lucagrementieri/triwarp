Benchmarks for ``triwarp.curvature``.

Axis: **scale**, plus a **radius** sweep on every group — and the second matters more. All three
functions gather a neighborhood before computing anything, so their cost is ``V * k_bar``, and
``k_bar`` grows with the *square* of the radius on a surface: doubling it is roughly four times the
work at an unchanged vertex count. That is why the radius is swept explicitly rather than pinned to
one value that would hide the exponent.

Three functions, three cost profiles:

* ``principal_curvature`` — a per-vertex 5x5 float64 least-squares quadric fit over a geodesic-ball
  neighborhood. The collection ([`geodesic_ball`][triwarp.neighbors.geodesic_ball], timed on its own
  in [`test_proximity.py`](test_proximity.py)) is part of the call, so this number is "ball + fit"
  and the fit is what a change to the 5x5 solver moves.
* ``discrete_gaussian_curvature`` — a hash-grid ball query plus a segmented scatter-sum of vertex
  defects. Cheap, memory-bound, dominated by the query.
* ``discrete_mean_curvature`` — the same query shape over *edges*, so it also pays face adjacency
  and the per-edge dihedral angles.

Why the clean spheres rather than the scan meshes
-------------------------------------------------
``igl.principal_curvature`` **segfaults** on every scan mesh — they have non-manifold vertices and
libigl's vertex-ring walk assumes manifoldness, so it takes the pytest process with it rather than
raising. The ``scale`` axis is manifold by construction, so libigl runs on all three points and the
comparison is drawn on the same meshes triwarp is measured on. **Not** on the ``valence`` axis: that
ring walk is quadratic in valence, and ``fan_hub``'s forty-thousand-face hub takes minutes. The
guard is explicit rather than implied by the axis, because the failure mode is a wall-clock blowout
that looks like a hang.

References
----------
**libigl**: ``igl.principal_curvature(..., useKring=False)`` is the sphere-neighborhood variant
triwarp reproduces — the ``useKring=True`` default collects a combinatorial k-ring instead, a
different neighborhood and so a different amount of work — timed at the same radius multiplier.

**trimesh** is the reference for the two Cohen-Steiner / Morvan measures, given the same query
points and radius. **open3d** has no curvature estimation at all, and does not even expose vertex
angle defects.

**pymeshlab** covers all three groups and is the only reference surviving the *whole* scale axis on
the two measures, where trimesh is capped at ``sphere_small`` by its per-point cKDTree ball. Two
filters:

``compute_curvature_principal_directions_per_vertex`` is the quadric-fit analogue, and its
``method`` menu matters: the two expensive variants are more than an order of magnitude dearer than
the one triwarp implements and are deliberately not benchmarked. **The radius sweep does not map** —
MeshLab exposes no neighborhood size for the fit — so its row appears at the narrow radius only.
That internal neighborhood is what the row actually measures: against the analytic ``H = 1`` of a
unit icosphere it is equivalent to ``radius = 2``, so the benchmarked ``radius = 3`` row is already
doing more work than the reference. Read the ratio with that in mind.

It is **not** a test oracle, and that is a deliberate rejection. On ``torus`` at ``radius = 2`` the
two correlate at 0.982 but carry a ~7 % systematic level offset — the neighborhood-size effect above
— where ``igl.principal_curvature(useKring=False)`` agrees element-wise to 1e-3, so libigl is
strictly the better oracle and pymeshlab would only loosen it. The other three ``method=`` variants
are worse still: ``'Normal Cycles'`` is area-integrated rather than pointwise, ``'Taubin
approximation'`` produces outliers orders of magnitude out, and ``'Scale Dependent Quadric
Fitting'`` reproduces plain Quadric Fitting at many times the cost.

``compute_scalar_by_discrete_curvature_per_vertex`` gives Gaussian and Mean from one filter, but it
is the Meyer / Desbrun **pointwise 1-ring** operator rather than the Cohen-Steiner / Morvan ball
measure triwarp and trimesh compute. So it has no radius axis and its absolute value is not
comparable — it is a *throughput* reference for a per-vertex curvature pass over the same mesh,
which is what makes it useful where trimesh cannot run.

Both mutate only an attribute, but ``compute_curvature_principal_directions_per_vertex`` defaults to
``autoclean=True`` and would delete unreferenced vertices under a shared MeshSet, so both build
inside the timed callable; the build is a small share across the whole scale axis.

The timed callable holds everything the public function does. For the Gaussian measure that includes
the vertex-defect recomputation, so the trimesh reference builds its ``tm.Trimesh`` inside the timed
region too — otherwise its cached ``vertex_defects`` / ``face_adjacency`` / ``kdtree`` properties
would make rounds 2..n measure only the ball query. The precomputed inputs are the ones triwarp's
signature asks the caller for.
