Benchmarks for ``triwarp.texture``.

Two inverse pairs, with opposite cost drivers:

* **Rasterize** (``rasterize_attribute``, ``rasterize_discrete_attribute``) — scatter: one thread
  per triangle walks the pixels its UV-space bounding box covers and interpolates barycentrically.
  Cost is *total covered area in pixels*, so it scales with ``resolution ** 2`` far more strongly
  than with the face count, and it is sensitive to UV-space triangle size — many small triangles
  amortize the per-triangle setup badly. The discrete variant does strictly more per pixel: it
  accumulates per-label weights and takes an argmax instead of one lerp.
* **Remap** (``remap_attribute_from_uv``, ``remap_discrete_attribute_from_uv``) — gather: one thread
  per *vertex*, one bilinear (``order=1``) or nearest (``order=0``) fetch. Cost is the vertex count,
  essentially independent of resolution beyond cache behaviour, so these are two orders of magnitude
  cheaper and are launch-latency bound on the smaller meshes. Timing both orders isolates the
  interpolation from the gather.

Axis: the **scan sweep** for the face-count half, plus a **resolution** sweep of 512 against 2048 on
every group. Those are the module's two independent sizes and they pull in opposite directions, so
pinning either hides half the story: the rasterizers should show a ~16x step across the resolution
pair and the remappers none at all beyond cache effects. A rasterizer that fails to scale
quadratically, or a remapper that does, is the signal this pair exists to produce.

UV coordinates
--------------
The scan meshes carry no UV map, and computing a real one per case is not viable: an LSCM or
harmonic parametrization needs disk topology (these are near-closed) and would time the solver
rather than the rasterizer.

So UVs are the **vertices' xy coordinates normalized to the unit square** — a projection, not an
injective parametrization, so on a closed mesh front and back land on the same pixels and the
documented "lowest face index wins" rule resolves the overlap. That does not distort what is
measured: the rasterizer's cost is the number of (triangle, covered pixel) pairs, which a projection
produces just as faithfully, and the overlap additionally exercises the contention path a real atlas
would not. It *would* matter for a correctness comparison, which is why the parity tests use
synthetic injective UVs instead.

References
----------
**No CPU baseline is registered, and the reason is scope rather than absence.** Neither trimesh,
libigl nor open3d has a UV-space attribute rasterizer or sampler.

**pymeshlab has both directions** — ``transfer_attributes_to_texture_per_vertex`` forward,
``compute_color_from_texture_per_vertex`` inverse — so all five groups have a counterpart. What
keeps them from being rows, and from being parity oracles, was probed rather than assumed, and the
blocker is narrower than "the output is an image": **``pymeshlab.Image`` is write-only from
Python**, its whole public surface being ``width``, ``height`` and ``save``, so neither direction
has an in-memory route.

* **Forward.** The bake can only leave Python as a file, so a comparison goes through an 8-bit PNG.
  For a ``float32`` raster that makes the quantization a *difference* between the two sides rather
  than something both share — a class-D shape rather than a tolerance.
* **Inverse.** The sampler needs a texture *attached to the mesh*, and there is no array route to
  that either, only loading a mesh file that references an image file. That path does work, and
  reveals a second convention: **MeshLab samples with wrap addressing.** On a 32-column ramp
  texture, vertices at ``u = 1.0`` come back as 0 where the texel is 248 — ``u = 1`` wraps to column
  0 — while an interior sample reads correctly. On a *random* texture that makes all four UV corners
  return the same value, which reads as a broken oracle rather than an addressing rule.

So the inverse pair is reachable at 8 bits and on strictly interior UVs, at the cost of writing an
OBJ, an MTL and a PNG per case; the forward pair is not reachable at array level at all. Its
parameter surface is also large — the bake takes a texture size, a sampling density and an
interpolation mode that do not map one-to-one onto ``resolution`` and ``order`` — but that is the
smaller obstacle.

The references the *correctness* tests use are not benchmarkable baselines either: the forward
rasterizers are checked against **moderngl (OpenGL)**, which would time driver and context overhead
rather than an algorithm, and the inverse samplers against ``scipy.ndimage.map_coordinates``, which
samples a plain grid with no notion of UV or mesh topology — the right correctness oracle for the
interpolation and the wrong baseline for the operation. So these are before/after self-comparisons.
