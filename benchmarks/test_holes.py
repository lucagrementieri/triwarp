"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.holes``.

Axis: **loops_dp** -- ``rim_short`` (two loops of 512) against ``holes_many`` (512 loops of 3).
The module has the highest non-``N`` sensitivity in the package and this pair separates its two
independent drivers:

* **Loop length**, cubed. ``fill_min_weight`` runs a minimum-weight triangulation DP over a
  ``B x B`` table per loop, filled by ``B - 2`` *sequential* kernel launches, then traced back one
  thread per loop without the table ever leaving the device. Total work is ``sum(B_i^3)`` and no
  batching can remove it: this is the real cost the module exists to pay. At ``rim_short`` the span
  sweep's host launch cost and its device time are now within ~20% of each other and overlap, so
  removing launches there is worth at most that gap -- read "launch-bound" as a claim about the
  *many-rim* end, where the sweep is one launch and everything else is fixed cost.

  Most of what *can* be removed already was. Widening the per-span launch from one thread per
  interval to one *block* per interval, its lanes striding the apex loop, is worth several-fold on
  the long rims: the grid is ``n_loops * (max_B - span)`` wide, so two long rims put ~1 024 threads
  on the machine and the whole ``B^3`` term ran at a fraction of a percent of it. Same launch
  count, same DP, byte-identical triangulation (see ``fill_dp_span_tiled``).
* **Loop count**, which should cost nothing and does so only because the DP is batched across
  loops. Per loop it would be a ``.numpy()`` readback, a forbidden-chord pass over the whole mesh
  and its own span launches, so many three-vertex holes -- where the DP itself is one triangle per
  hole -- cost *more* than the genuinely expensive long-rim point. Batching also runs
  ``rim_short``'s two rims concurrently. The last per-loop host term was the traceback, a Python
  stack walk per rim over a read-back predecessor table; on ``holes_many`` it alone was 22% of the
  call, and moving it onto the device took the whole group 1.21x.

That is why the axis meshes are *small*: face count is not the variable, and sizing these meshes up
would only add DP table entries that the ``B^3`` term already dominates. The two points differ by
several-fold in the right direction, which is what the axis is for -- an *inversion* there is the
tell that a per-loop sequence has crept back in. ``fill_fan`` runs on the wider **loops** axis
instead, because it
has no DP and so can afford ``rim_long``'s much longer rims -- it is the floor this module's cost is
measured against.

This group's median moves substantially between runs of the *same* code depending on which
reference rows share the process, so read ratios rather than absolutes here.

One cost the ``loops_dp`` pair cannot see is the default subdivision-target derivation inside
``fill_smooth``: its axis is the raw loop *count*, and 512 loops is too few for it to register
against the DP. ``fill_smooth_target_edge`` runs that one path on the **loops_dense** axis
(512 -> 8 192 loops on the same vertex buffer) instead.

References
----------
**trimesh**'s ``repair.fill_holes`` is a much weaker algorithm (it fans triangles across small
holes and gives up on large ones), so it is timing context rather than an equivalent -- the
assertion only checks that faces were added or preserved.

**open3d**'s ``fill_holes`` lives on the newer tensor API (``open3d.t.geometry.TriangleMesh``) and
wraps a hole-filling pass over the boundary loops, which is the closest analogue to triwarp's
minimum-weight triangulation. It returns a new tensor mesh, but ``from_legacy`` is a full
conversion, so that conversion is hoisted out of the timed callable and only ``fill_holes`` is
measured.

**pymeshlab**'s ``meshing_close_holes`` is a third algorithm again -- an ear-clipping fill with an
optional self-intersection check (``selfintersection=True`` by default, left on) rather than a
minimum-weight DP. One parameter matters and it is a trap: **``maxholesize`` is an edge count with a
default of 30**, so on the long-rim axis point the filter closes *nothing* and returns immediately
with ``{'closed_holes': 0}``. Lifting it is what makes the axis points comparable at all; the dict
it returns is what makes that checkable, and the assertion below reads it.

Note what the axis then says: the reference's two axis points are close together where triwarp's
differ by more than an order of magnitude. That is the ``B^3`` term -- MeshLab's ear clipping is
quadratic at worst, so it does not pay it, and its rows are the honest price of *not* computing a
minimum-weight triangulation.

    Which rims a min-weight fill can close: one edge pass, plus one readback of the rims.

    The chord test is a sweep over every unique edge, so the cost tracks the *mesh* rather than the
    boundary; the pinch test rides on one readback of the loops, which tracks the boundary. Read
    against ``fill_min_weight`` -- the point of the mask is that it is a small fraction of the fill
    it predicts, so a caller can afford to ask first.

    meshlib's half of the answer is ``findRepeatedVertsOnHoleBd``, the pinch condition, which is the
    only one of its three fillability predicates this ports (the other two are recorded as not
    matching in ``tests/test_holes.py``). So the row is a **partial** comparison on the reference
    side and does strictly less work -- read it as a floor, not as a like-for-like.

    The first version read each rim back separately; the rims are concatenated on the device now and
    read in one transfer, which was worth about 2x. What is
    left is the chord sweep, which is a pass over every unique edge and so tracks the mesh -- there
    is no smaller correct version of that test, and it is the half meshlib does not do at all.

    **Attributed per stage, every benchmarked row is now a floor row.**
    The floor is **``edges_unique``** -- the shared unique/group stack, which has its own group and
    its own floor, and which is flat here across the face range, so it is that stack's fixed cost
    rather than this function's. Nothing local can move it: even deleting the chord test outright
    leaves a floor an order of magnitude above meshlib's cached-topology arithmetic. Two things were
    taken because they were free rather than because they showed up: the rim concatenation now
    re-uses the buffer ``boundary_loops`` already packed (``copy=False``, see
    ``benchmarks/test_boundary.py::test_loop_perimeters``), and an ``index_bound`` readback is gone
    because ``vertices`` already states the bound.

    ``dragon``'s remainder used to be a Python loop over its 407 rims building two vertex-indexed
    tables, and that was the one stage here with an algorithm left in it. It is gone: the pinch
    tests are one per-vertex slot count on the device and the tables are scattered by a kernel, so
    the whole predicate is readback-free and the many-rim row is 2.4x what it was while the
    few-rim rows are unchanged. What that removes is a *loop-count* term, which is why it does not
    show on ``bunny``.

    and it is small.

    The largest margin in this module -- well over an order of magnitude ahead of meshlib at every

    Greedy nearest-link agglomeration over *open* shells: the driver, not the bridge.

    **The axis is the join count, and the face count is very nearly free.** At a fixed face count
    triwarp is linear in the ``k - 1`` joins; holding the components fixed and cutting the mesh
    instead barely moves it, a 4x face reduction costing a percent. That is the shape the function's
    own Notes predict -- each round rebuilds the component labelling and the rim table from the
    updated face buffer, and each is a fixed chain of wrapper calls whose launch overhead dominates
    the per-face work at these sizes.

    So this group watches the **round count times the per-round chain**, and anything that moves it
    will be a launch removed from that chain rather than a faster kernel. One such change is already
    in: the pair selection and ``bridge_edges``' rim check used to build the same oriented boundary
    table twice per round, which was a seventh or so of the call.

    A closed lattice cannot serve this. ``parts_64`` returns **0 bridges** -- a shell with no
    boundary has nothing to bridge to and is left alone by design -- so the ``components`` axis
    would time a no-op, which is why ``open_components`` exists and drops one face per shell.

    The ratio *narrows* with the join count because triwarp's per-round chain is the launch-bound
    part while MeshFix's is sequential C++ over a halfedge structure it already holds -- the gap is
    widest where triwarp's fixed overhead is amortized least.

    pymeshfix's row is timed rather than declared because the operation clears its load by a wide
    margin, which is the ~30 % rule in ``conftest``'s LIBRARIES block -- from half the round at the
    fewest components to nearly all of it at the most. That split is an isolated measurement, since
    the harness can only time the whole callable: the load cannot leave it, a ``PyTMesh`` taking
    exactly one ``load_array``. So read the row as join-plus-load and subtract accordingly, most of
    all at the few-component point, where the load is over half of it and the reported ratio
    correspondingly overstates the algorithmic gap.

    Both sides add exactly ``2 * (k - 1)`` faces and no vertices, which is what the assertions
    check: a driver that fanned a rim or joined the wrong number of shells fails on the count. The
    parity claim compares the same counts, because the two pick different incident edges to bridge
    and so need not produce the same two triangles.
