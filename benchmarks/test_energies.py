"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.energies``: the quadratic forms assembled from a Laplacian.

Split out of [`test_laplacian.py`](test_laplacian.py) with the module. The distinction that makes it
its own file is what the timed callable *takes*: everything here consumes an already-assembled
operator, so its inputs are cached per mesh on both sides and the row measures the assembly of the
second-order form alone. ``test_laplacian.py`` times the first-order builders these are fed.

All five rows run the **scale** axis (``sphere_small`` -> ``sphere_med`` -> ``sphere_large``) rather
than the scan sweep, and the ratio against igl grows with size on every one of them, because igl's
side is Eigen sparse products where triwarp's is a fixed number of launches. libigl is the only
reference that exposes these operators at all -- no other library has a Crouzeix-Raviart pair, a
curved Hessian energy or an integrated k-harmonic form.

The LSCM operators (``lscm_hessian``, ``vector_area_matrix``) are **not** timed here: neither has an
igl binding of its own, and their cost is measured through the ``lscm`` solve in
[`test_parametrization.py`](test_parametrization.py), which is the only way a caller reaches them.
Recorded in ``README.md``.
