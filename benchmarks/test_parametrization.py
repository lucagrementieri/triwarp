"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.parametrization``.

Two axes, because these solvers have two independent cost drivers and mesh size is neither of
them outright:

* **patch** -- ``saddle_small`` / ``saddle`` / ``hemisphere``, the disk-topology inputs these
  solvers are actually for, flat and curved, spanning 8 978 to 41 088 faces. This is the size
  sweep, restricted to meshes that *have* a single boundary loop to pin.
* **quality** -- ``saddle`` against ``saddle_graded``. Same vertices, same faces, same boundary,
  same everything except the spacing along one axis, which pushes the worst triangle aspect ratio
  from 1.6 to 4 719. Cotangent weights go large and the free-block condition number goes with them,
  so the conjugate-gradient iteration count moves while nothing else does. That is the cleanest
  available measurement of conditioning cost, and it is invisible to any face-count sweep.

Setup that is *not* part of the measured operation is precomputed and cached: the boundary loop,
its circle map, and the harmonic warm start ARAP iterates from. What remains inside the timed
callable is what the function itself does -- operator assembly plus the CG solve -- because that is
what the batched-CG work targets.

``harmonic`` / ``lscm`` / ``arap`` solve with ``warp.optim.linear.cg``, which returned NaN on the
Warp CPU backend through 1.15 and made the ``triwarp-cpu`` variant unrunnable. It converges there
now, so those rows are timed rather than skipped -- CPU CG is correct, not fast, and the ratio is
the point.

----------
**libigl** now runs on every mesh in both axes, which it did not on the previous mesh set. It goes
through a direct LDLT factorization of the cotangent system, and that failed outright on the
scanned registry meshes (``RuntimeError: Failed to compute harmonic map`` / ``igl::lscm failed``):
they are not disk topology and their cotangent Laplacian is not positive definite on the free set.
The patch and quality meshes are disk topology by construction, so the comparison is drawn on
exactly the meshes triwarp is measured on rather than on a small subset. This also makes the
quality axis a genuine A/B between an iterative and a direct solver: CG pays for conditioning in
iterations, LDLT pays for it in fill-in, and they do not have to move together.

``rim_long`` is deliberately **not** used here. It is an annulus, and pinning only one of its rims
leaves ARAP free to fold: triwarp returns 32 767 flipped faces out of 131 072, disagrees with
libigl by 0.35 regardless of CG tolerance (the two land on different local minima of a non-convex
energy), and burns 8 200 CG iterations per solve on the resulting near-singular system. Timing
that measures a pathology, not the algorithm.

**open3d** has no mesh parametrization at all -- no harmonic map, no LSCM, no ARAP, and no
boundary circle map.

**pymeshlab** covers ``harmonic`` and ``lscm``, and its own filter descriptions say why it is a
*second* reference rather than a third implementation: both
``compute_texcoord_parametrization_harmonic`` and
``compute_texcoord_parametrization_least_squares_conformal_maps`` state that they use "the original
code provided in the libigl library". So they wrap the same solver the ``igl`` rows call directly,
and the gap between the two is MeshLab's own boundary detection, attribute plumbing and MeshSet
build rather than a different algorithm. That is worth having -- it prices what a *library wrapper*
adds over the bare call -- but it is not independent evidence, and it should not be read as such.

**Its ``harm_function`` parameter is documented as triwarp's ``k`` (1 harmonic, 2 biharmonic) and is
a no-op in pymeshlab 2025.7.** Measured on ``saddle_small``: ``harm_function=1``, ``2`` and ``3``
return **bit-identical** texture coordinates (max deviation exactly 0.0), and identical timings
(94.4 / 92.7 ms on ``hemisphere``) where libigl's own ``k=2`` costs 4.3x its ``k=1``. So the
harmonic order axis does not map, and the pymeshlab row appears at ``k=1`` only. Do not re-derive
this: a row that tracked triwarp's ``k=2`` here would be silently reporting the ``k=1`` solve.

LSCM takes no parameters at all: MeshLab pins the boundary condition itself rather than accepting a
pin set, so unlike triwarp's two-pin call there is nothing to match there.

**It rejects closed meshes outright**, with ``PyMeshLabException: Harmonic Parametrization can be
applied only on meshes ...`` -- a boundary loop is required. Both axes here are disk-topology by
construction, so that is a documented hazard rather than a skip, but it is the reason a pymeshlab
parametrization row can never move to the scan sweep or the ``scale`` axis.

Both filters rewrite the per-vertex texture coordinates, so the MeshSet is rebuilt per round; on the
``patch`` axis the build is 2-5 ms against rows of 18-335 ms.
