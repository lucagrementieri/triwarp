"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.mesh.Trimesh``: what a cold cached property costs.

Axis: **cache state**, which is not a mesh property at all. ``Trimesh`` is a lazily-computed
container -- first access to ``warp_mesh`` or ``face_adjacency`` or ``boundary_loops`` runs the real
work, every access after that is a dict lookup. So the honest question about this class is not "how
does it scale" (each property scales the way its own module's benchmark says it does) but "which
properties are expensive enough that a caller needs to know they are being computed", and the
warm/cold gap is the only way to see that.

Each group therefore times two rows on the same mesh:

* **cold** -- a freshly constructed ``Trimesh``, built *inside* the timed callable, so every round
  pays the full computation. Construction itself is two array assignments and is negligible.
* **warm** -- one shared instance whose property was already forced, so the row measures the dict
  lookup and nothing else. It exists as the floor: a warm row that is not ~0 means the property is
  not actually being cached.

The ratio between them is what a caller saves by holding onto the mesh, and it is the number to
quote when deciding whether an API should take a ``Trimesh`` or raw buffers.

Cache invalidation is a third row where it applies. ``with_vertices`` keeps every topology cache and
only drops the geometric ones, ``with_faces`` drops everything; that distinction is the reason
``with_vertices`` exists, so it is measured rather than asserted.

Properties chosen
-----------------
The six that are expensive for genuinely different reasons: ``warp_mesh`` (a BVH build),
``vertex_normals`` (an atomic scatter), ``face_adjacency`` (an edge sort plus manifold-pair
grouping), ``boundary_loops`` (pointer-jumping list ranking plus per-loop host work),
``is_watertight`` (which composes an edge test with a self-intersection pass over a fresh BVH) and
``vector_heat_operators`` (three sparse assemblies, and the priciest of the lot). Timing all of them
would just re-run the rest of the suite through a different door.

Cold cost of every property, measured on ``icosphere(5)`` (20 480 faces) on an RTX 5090, minimum of
five fresh instances, for the record this module exists to keep:

| property | ms | property | ms |
|---|---|---|---|
| ``vector_heat_operators`` | **7.20** | ``cotmatrix`` | 0.655 |
| ``is_watertight`` | 4.23 | ``vertex_one_rings`` | 0.587 |
| ``heat_operators`` | 2.91 | ``halfedge_twins`` | 0.277 |
| ``vertex_tangent_frames`` | 1.27 | ``warp_mesh`` | 0.248 |
| ``laplacian_operator`` | 0.665 | ``mass_matrix_entries`` | 0.151 |
| | | ``vertex_face_adjacency`` | 0.121 |
| | | ``bounds`` | 0.089 |

So the operator group at the bottom of the class is where the cache pays, and ``is_watertight`` is
no longer the priciest property -- it was when it was written, and the two heat bundles arrived
after it.

References
----------
**trimesh**'s ``Trimesh`` is the model this class mirrors, and it caches the same way, so the cold
rows are directly comparable -- the trimesh side is likewise rebuilt inside the timed callable. It
has no ``with_vertices`` / ``with_faces`` equivalent (assigning to ``mesh.vertices`` invalidates
everything), so the invalidation group is triwarp-only. open3d and libigl have no caching container
at all: open3d recomputes on request and libigl is free functions over raw arrays.
