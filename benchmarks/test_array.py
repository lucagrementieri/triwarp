"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.array``: the packing, sorting and compaction primitives.

Every group here sweeps **segment or selection count**, not mesh size, because that is the axis
these primitives actually respond to. ``pack_1d_arrays`` and ``concatenate`` issue one ``wp.copy``
per input segment on top of a fixed amount of host-side Python, so holding the total element count
fixed and moving only the number of segments separates the two costs: flat means the copies
dominate and the Python loops are noise, rising means the per-segment overhead is the thing to
attack. ``flatnonzero`` sweeps selectivity for the same reason -- the scan is oblivious to it and
only the scatter's output size moves.

**That question has been answered and the axis was the right one: rising, steeply, and the
per-segment overhead is not attackable.** The packing family's cost is a per-*segment* host
constant -- 6.02 µs a ``wp.copy``, 15.06 µs a ``wp.clone``, 3.63 µs a ``wp.array`` view -- while
the same total moved in one call costs 0.015 ms whatever its size, so the rows are flat over a
4 000x range of bytes and linear in the segment count. The break-even against NumPy is a segment
size of **~98 kB**, and it does not move with the count. ``_SEGMENT_COUNTS`` brackets it: ``few``
on ``dragon`` is 2.6 MB a segment and wins 0.05-0.19x, ``many`` on ``bunny_decimated`` is 0.76 kB
a segment and loses up to 71.89x. Both numbers are the same statement about segment size, which is
why the loss half of that bracket is not a work item -- see ``test_concatenate`` and ``test_split``
for the sweeps and for the levers (graph capture, a shared output buffer, raw view construction)
that were measured and declined.

``sort_and_argsort`` and ``gather`` are the two primitives on the hot path of nearly every other
module (``grouping.group``, ``adjacency.face_adjacency``, every submesh extraction), so they are
timed on mesh-derived buffers at whatever size the suite is running.

References
----------
**NumPy is the reference, on the same grounds ``benchmarks/test_reduce.py`` argues at length.** An
earlier version of this paragraph said the opposite -- that "timing NumPy would generally compare a
host implementation against a device one" -- and cited ``test_reduce.py`` as agreeing, which it does
not: that module carries a numpy row on all ten of its groups and treats the host/device asymmetry
as *the question* rather than as a reason not to ask it. A device primitive that hands back a Python
value pays a launch and a readback NumPy never pays, so NumPy should win at small sizes and each row
answers where the crossover sits.

``test_reduce`` also measured the answer, and it transfers: **the split is by return type, not by
size.** The groups here that hand back a device array (``concatenate_arrays``, ``gather``,
``sort_and_argsort``) have no host synchronisation to pay and should track bandwidth;
``flatnonzero`` and ``split_array`` end in a 4-byte tail readback and an ``offsets`` transfer
respectively, so they carry the flat host cost that sets the crossover. ``pack_1d_arrays`` is the
pair to read ``concatenate_arrays`` against: the offsets are host metadata on both sides.

trimesh, igl, open3d and pymeshlab stay unregistered here and it is not a judgement -- they operate
a level above and expose nothing comparable. ``index_bound``'s "trimesh" row is likewise a
NumPy stand-in (``int(faces.max()) + 1``) rather than a library call, because trimesh has no
*uncached* equivalent: its vertex count comes from the array it was built with. That row predates
this section and is the group that first established the crossover is inside the registry's size
range.

    One buffer from many, at two segment counts with the total element count held fixed.

    **triwarp charges per segment, NumPy charges per byte, and that one sentence predicts every
    row in this group to within 5 %.** Measured on an RTX 5090, sweeping the segment size with the
    count fixed at 256, and the count with the total fixed at ``dragon``'s 2 614 242 elements:

    | kB per segment | triwarp | numpy | ratio | | segments | triwarp | numpy | ratio |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | 32.8 | 1.592 ms | 0.567 | 2.81x | | 2 | 0.033 ms | 0.639 | **0.05x** |
    | 65.5 | 1.667 | 1.115 | 1.50x | | 16 | 0.199 | 0.655 | **0.30x** |
    | **98.3** | 1.701 | 1.837 | **0.93x** | | 64 | 0.407 | 0.665 | 0.61x |
    | 131.1 | 1.686 | 4.666 | 0.36x | | 256 | 1.651 | 0.668 | 2.47x |
    | 196.6 | 1.741 | 8.409 | 0.21x | | 1 024 | 6.346 | 0.734 | 8.64x |

    The left column is **flat over a 6x range of bytes** -- and stays flat over 4 000x, 1.46 ms
    at 0.07 MB total and 2.42 ms at 268 MB -- because the cost is 256 ``warp.copy`` calls at
    **6.02 µs** each. Copying the same 2 614 242 elements in *one* ``warp.copy`` is **0.015 ms**,
    so the data movement is 1 % of the row and 99 % is per-call host cost. NumPy's column is a
    host ``memcpy`` and rises with the bytes.

    So the break-even is a **segment size of ~98 kB (~24 576 ``int32``), and it does not move with
    the segment count** -- 1.01x at 64 segments, 0.93x at 256. Every ratio in this group is
    ``98 kB / segment size``: the ``dragon`` ``many`` row's segments are 40.8 kB, predicting 2.40x
    against a measured **2.47x**. That is why the axis is a segment *count* at a fixed total and why
    the two points bracket the crossover rather than sitting on one side of it: ``few`` on
    ``dragon`` is 2.6 MB a segment and triwarp wins it **0.09x**, ``many`` on ``bunny_decimated`` is
    0.76 kB a segment and loses 71.89x. Both are the same statement about segment size.

    **Two levers were measured and both are declined**, so this row is a floor and not a to-do.
    Graph capture: recording the copy loop and replaying it once is **0.84-0.88x** at 256, 1 024 and
    4 096 segments -- a loss at every count, because a pack's pointers change per call so the
    recording is never reused; replaying an *existing* graph is 7.7-8.5x, which is the number that
    makes capture look attractive and is unreachable here. And a segmented gather kernel is not
    available: Warp has no array-of-arrays and a kernel cannot dereference a raw pointer.

    **pytorch3d**'s ``padded_to_packed`` is the same concatenation from the other direction: it
    reads a dense ``(n_segments, max_size)`` block and writes the flat buffer, so it is the *only*
    reference here that does it in one device kernel rather than per segment -- which is exactly the
    lever the two declined ones above are not. It is not free of a cost model of its own: the padded
    block is ``n_segments * max_size`` elements whatever the true lengths, so at ``many`` on an
    uneven split it moves more memory than there is data, and the block is built outside the timed
    callable because it is the input. Read the row as "what a segmented gather would cost if Warp
    had one"; ``tests/test_array.py::test_the_packing_family_matches_pytorch3d`` pins the two forms
    to byte equality.

    The inverse of ``pack_1d_arrays``: one offsets readback, then views or per-segment clones.

    The ``views`` rows price the readback plus Python slicing alone; the gap to ``copies`` at
    ``many`` is the per-segment ``wp.clone`` launches, the same per-segment floor the packing
    direction pays.

    NumPy's ``split`` has the same two modes and the same names for them -- its result is views, and
    a copy is one ``np.copy`` per piece -- so the ``views`` / ``copies`` pair reads across both
    libraries and the ratio between the pairs is the readback triwarp cannot avoid.

    **Both modes are per-segment constants, and the readback is not one of them.** Measured on an
    RTX 5090 at 256 segments, and flat from 48 903 to 2 614 242 total elements:

    | stage | cost | per segment |
    |---|---|---|
    | ``offsets.numpy()`` readback | 0.026 ms | -- (one transfer, whatever the count) |
    | the slice comprehension (``views``) | 0.930 | **3.63 µs** a ``warp.array`` view |
    | the ``warp.clone`` loop (``copies``) | 3.855 | **15.06 µs** = a 10 µs alloc plus a 6 µs copy |

    So the readback the docstring above blames is **2.6 % of the ``views`` row**; what the row
    actually prices is Python-side ``warp.array`` construction, and ``copies`` is that plus one
    allocation and one copy per piece. The crossover is the same segment size
    ``concatenate_arrays`` measures (~98 kB), and the ``copies`` rows invert on the group's own
    axis: ``dragon`` at ``few`` is **0.19x**, a win.

    **Two levers were measured and both are declined.** Allocating **one** buffer, filling it with a
    single ``warp.copy`` and returning disjoint views of *that* is **3.93-4.02x** at 256-4 096
    segments -- but it is then no longer the operation NumPy's column performs (``np.copy`` per
    piece is an independent allocation each), so it would win the row by doing less, and it would
    silently drop half of what ``copy=True`` is documented to promise: a segment could no longer be
    held without keeping the whole buffer alive. Building the views with a raw
    ``warp.array(ptr=...)`` instead of ``flat[a:b]`` is **1.57-1.69x** (3.71 -> 2.19 µs a segment)
