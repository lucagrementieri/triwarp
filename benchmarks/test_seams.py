"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.seams``: crease detection and the topological cut along a seam set.

Two groups, on two different mesh sets, because they have two different preconditions:

* ``crease_edges`` runs the **scan sweep**. It is a face-adjacency build plus one threshold — pure
  throughput, and the group to read as a floor for anything that consumes a feature set. Face
  adjacency tolerates a non-manifold edge (it drops it), so every registry mesh is fair game.
* ``cut_along_edges`` runs on the synthetic **icospheres** instead, and the reason is a hard
  precondition rather than a preference: the cut is defined through halfedge twins, so it needs an
  edge-manifold mesh, and ``bunny_decimated`` has **150 edges shared by three or more faces**.
  triwarp raises there and so does MeshLab (``this filter require manifoldness``), so neither side
  has a number to report — the same boundary the midpoint-subdivision references run into (see the
  benchmarks README hazard table).

The cut's cost is halfedge twins, a key set for the marked edges, a corner-graph build and a
**connected-components pass over ``3F`` nodes**. The sweep that matters for it is therefore not only
size but *how much* is cut, since that sets how far the components pass has to contract: the
``cut_fraction`` parameter takes it from a quarter of the interior edges to all of them.

References
----------
**pymeshlab** covers both: ``compute_selection_crease_per_edge`` is the same dihedral threshold
(reported as a vertex selection, so it is selection-only and shares the MeshSet) and
``meshing_cut_along_crease_edges`` is the cut — which finds the creases *and* cuts them in one call,
so that row is an upper bound on triwarp's cut alone and should be read against the sum of the two
triwarp rows. It rewrites the topology, so its MeshSet is rebuilt inside the timed callable. Its cut
row exists only at ``cut_fraction=1.0``: the filter takes a dihedral threshold rather than an edge
set, so ``angledeg=0`` (cut everything non-coplanar) is the only setting comparable to a triwarp
fraction.

One structural difference is worth knowing before comparing outputs rather than times: on a cube cut
at every crease, triwarp emits the **minimal** 24 vertices and MeshLab 32 (see
``tests/test_seams.py``). Both give 6 components and the same area, so the extra copies are
redundant rather than wrong — but they are extra memory in every downstream pass.

Neither trimesh, igl nor open3d has a cut along a marked edge set at all: trimesh's
``unmerge_vertices`` splits *every* edge (a full soup) rather than a chosen set, which is the
degenerate case rather than the operation.

    Twins, key set, corner graph and a components pass over ``3F`` nodes.

    The two fractions are the two ends of the components pass: at ``0.25`` most corners still merge,
    so the pass contracts ``3F`` nodes down toward ``V``, while at ``1.0`` the corner graph has no
    edges at all and every node is already its own component. If the second is *faster*, the
    contraction is the cost and is the thing to attack.

    ``igl.cut_mesh`` is the reference that takes the same *edge set* triwarp does, once it is
    rewritten as the ``(n_faces, 3)`` per-corner bool mask the binding wants -- that rewrite is an
    input transform and is cached outside the timed callable, like ``_cut_edges`` itself. It is the
    only reference here that can run at both fractions, since MeshLab takes a dihedral threshold
    instead of a set. It also **agrees with triwarp on the output size** where MeshLab does not (24
    vertices against 32 on a cut cube; see ``tests/test_seams.py``), which is what makes the third
    row worth having.

    **The two sides slope in opposite directions across the fraction**, and that is the finding this
    row adds: measured on ``sphere_large``, triwarp goes 2.90 -> 2.12 ms from ``0.25`` to ``1.0``
    (faster when everything is cut, because the components pass has nothing left to contract) while
    igl goes 34.4 -> 61.9 (slower, because its per-corner walk pays for each new vertex it emits).
    So the contraction really is triwarp's cost here, and it is not a cost igl has.
