"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.geodesic_walk``: batched straightest-geodesic geodesic_walk.

Two axes, and the parameter is the interesting one:

* **ray count** -- one thread traces one ray, so this is the axis the design is *for*. potpourri3d's
  ``GeodesicTracer`` traces one ray per call, which makes its row linear in the count by
  construction; the point of the comparison is where the crossover sits, not who wins at one ray.
* **diameter** -- ``sphere_med`` against ``ribbon_long`` at pinned ``V``. Each ray walks a fixed
  arc length, so meshes with similar triangle sizes give the same per-ray step count; what changes
  is locality, and this axis says whether that matters.

Both entry points do the same walk. ``trace_from_face`` skips the wedge search that
``trace_from_vertex`` needs to pick a starting face, so timing them apart separates the
walk from the setup.

References
----------
**potpourri3d** is the only reference with an equivalent, and it covers **all three** walk groups:
``GeodesicTracer`` binds ``trace_geodesic_from_vertex`` *and* ``trace_geodesic_from_face``, the two
entry points this module splits, so every axis here has a second implementation rather than just the
ray-count one. Two things to keep in mind when reading its rows: it traces a single ray per call
(the API takes one start point), and its construction -- building geometry-central's halfedge mesh
-- is inside the timed callable, matching this suite's convention for reference setup. triwarp's row
likewise includes its own ``halfedge_twins`` and one-ring prologue.

That construction is the *dominant* term once the mesh is large -- an order of magnitude or more
over the tracing itself -- so on the ``scale`` axis the reference row is essentially a build
benchmark, and the per-ray comparison lives in the ``trace_rays`` ray-count sweep where the build is
amortized across up to 4 096 rays.

**trimesh**, **libigl**, **open3d** and **scipy** have nothing comparable: tracing a straightest
geodesic needs an unfolding walk across edges, and none of them exposes one. ``igl`` does join
the ``geodesic_path`` group through ``exact_geodesic``, whose *distance* bounds any path length.

``shorten_loop`` runs on a third axis, **genus**, against potpourri3d's
``EdgeFlipGeodesicSolver.find_geodesic_loop``. It is the only axis in either registry with a
genus, and it is shared with ``benchmarks/test_homology.py``, which produces this group's input.

    Point-to-point geodesics: one heat solve, then one descent per target.

    The **path count** is the axis, and it is the axis this design exists for in a stronger sense
    than ``trace_rays``: the heat solve is shared by every target, so its cost is amortized away
    while the walks are independent. A single path pays the whole factorization and 4 096 pay it
    once, which is what the three points are there to show -- and it is also why the references,
    both of which do per-pair work, are expected to cross over.

    ``potpourri3d``'s ``EdgeFlipGeodesicSolver`` gives the *exact* geodesic (edge flips to a locally
    shortest path) and ``igl.exact_geodesic`` the exact geodesic **distance** by MMP window
    propagation, so neither is doing the same amount of work as an approximate descent. They are
    here for scale and because they bound the answer: ``tests/test_geodesic_walk.py`` asserts
    triwarp's path is never shorter than igl's exact distance and measures how much longer it is.
    Both take one query per call, so their rows include a Python loop -- read them as the cost of
    *that* API shape.

    The amortization is the whole row: **4 096 paths cost about twice what one costs**, because the
    heat solve is shared and only the walks scale. Against that, potpourri3d is linear in the path
    count and igl is flat but far off, since MMP propagates windows over the whole surface whatever
    is asked of it.

    triwarp's cost at *one* path is almost entirely the factorization, not the walk -- which is the
    honest caveat on the left column and the reason ``operators=`` exists on the wrapper.
