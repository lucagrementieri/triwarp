"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.reconstruction``.

The point cloud is a registry mesh's own vertices with area-weighted vertex normals — deterministic
(no sampling RNG), consistently oriented, and it scales with the mesh. Both are precomputed and
cached: they are the *input*, not part of the operation being timed.

**open3d** is the reference for ball pivoting
(``create_from_point_cloud_ball_pivoting``, Bernardini's BPA at the identical radius); it gets the
same points and computes its own area-weighted normals, the same quantity
[`vertex_normals`][triwarp.vertices.vertex_normals] produces.

**pymeshlab** is the third BPA implementation, and worth a row because
``generate_surface_reconstruction_ball_pivoting`` is VCGlib's original BPA — so its row and open3d's
price two wrappers over one lineage and only triwarp's is a different program. It gets the
identical absolute radius via ``PureValue`` (the ``0%`` default autoguesses one, which would
compare two different parameters) with ``clustering=0`` to disable a merge step triwarp does not do.
The filter
pushes its output as a new layer without touching the cloud, so the cloud MeshSet is cached;
``set_current_mesh(0)`` inside the callable restores the layer the previous round's push moved away
from.

**Screened Poisson is timed for triwarp alone.** Both CPU references wrap Kazhdan's own solver and
between them cost the **majority of the whole suite's wall clock** to re-measure a reference triwarp
beats by more than an order of magnitude, with the largest cell running well over an hour without
completing a round. The rows are **removed**, not capped, and the agreement they were the parity
evidence for is checked in ``tests/test_reconstruction.py`` at a size a correctness test can afford.
What remains is a triwarp-only regression row over ``method`` x ``depth``.

**The pymeshlab cloud is not quite the same cloud**, and that is forced rather than chosen: it drops
every point whose area-weighted normal is exactly zero — the unreferenced vertices every scan mesh
carries — because the screened-Poisson filter rejects a cloud carrying any null normal outright. The
cleaning is kept for the BPA row so the reference's input stays the documented one; the alternative,
``preclean=True``, moves the same cleaning *inside* the timed filter, which is worse.

``generate_surface_reconstruction_vcg`` was tried as a *fourth* algorithm and **rejected**: it
returns **zero faces** on this input at every voxel size probed. A row that silently measures a
no-op is worse than no row.

``triangulate_point_cloud`` has **meshlib** and nothing else. The nearest open3d and pymeshlab
analogues are alpha shapes — a different algorithm, so timing them would compare algorithm choices
rather than implementations — where ``triangulatePointCloud`` is the same local fan optimization at
the same ``numNeighbours`` and returns the identical face set on a clean uniform cloud.

``ball_pivoting`` is built around a **persistent front** — an edge hash table plus a compacted
boundary-edge list, mutated in place and never re-derived from the triangle soup. Three things pay
for it: retiring provably-dead front edges (under a per-wave rebuild most pivots are re-searches of
edges already known to be impossible), caching each front edge's best candidate so the majority that
lose a vertex claim re-validate in O(1), and dropping the per-wave ``edges_unique`` + sort + three
readbacks a rebuild needs. It also reconstructs a **much better surface** — far fewer faces per
referenced vertex, an order of magnitude fewer boundary edges — because a per-wave rebuild lets
colliding fronts triangulate a neighbourhood in overlapping layers, which cleanup then tears back
into open patches.

What is left is ``pivot_front_edges``, nearly all of the kernel time, and it is *occupancy*-bound:
a wave has a few hundred live front edges doing serial dependent work on a device with hundreds of
thousands of thread slots, which is why the smaller mesh is behind.

A warp per edge is the answer, and the *index* is what constrains it: Warp's hash grid exposes only
a sequential per-thread iterator with no per-cell entry point, so its walk — most of a query's cost
— cannot be split across lanes. Warp's **BVH** can be, through ``tile_bvh_query_aabb``, and that is
several-fold over the hash grid at the front sizes a wave has. (A *serial* BVH walk is slower than
the hash grid, so the win is the cooperation and not the tree; a hand-rolled hashed cell grid would
be a further several-fold this kernel's own ceiling cannot spend.) So ``pivot_front_edges`` runs one
block per front edge, one warp per block, walking the BVH cooperatively, with the empty-ball test
left as a per-lane serial hash-grid query — at that point each lane tests a different ball, so there
is nothing to cooperate on and the speedup comes from running 32-way concurrently. Worth nearly 5x
on both meshes, and it takes the group from several times behind pymeshlab to several times ahead.

Sizing notes:

- ``ball_pivoting`` uses ``1.5 * mean_edge``. The ``4 * n + 16`` triangle budget doubles on demand,
  so a larger multiple completes; it is not benchmarked, because a ball that wide searches a much
  larger neighbourhood per pivot and measures a different thing.
- ``screened_poisson`` in ``dense`` mode is dominated by the ``2 ** depth`` cubed node grid rather
  than the point count, so it costs the same on ``bunny_decimated`` and ``bunny``; ``adaptive`` does
  scale with the cloud. Both run at the default ``depth=8``.

Everything is capped at ``bunny``, and the cap is load-bearing: point-cloud triangulation and ball
pivoting are superlinear in the cloud size. The CPU screened-Poisson references made it
non-negotiable — one cell ran over an hour without completing a round — and those rows are now
removed outright rather than capped. The cap stays for the algorithms still timed against a
reference. This is a deliberate coverage gap: the optimizations these benchmarks gate are host-sync
and launch-overhead fixes, which show up at these sizes.

    Planar Delaunay triangulation, on the point-count axis -- the module's one mesh-free group.

    It takes ``bench_lib`` rather than ``bench_case`` for the reason ``test_creation.py``'s groups
    do: there is no input mesh, so the work is sized by a plain ``parametrize`` (the same 2-D cloud
    both references see, built once per size outside the timed region).

    !!! note "This row was the suite's largest loss, and both halves of it are now compiled"
        **The seed.** The overwhelming majority of the row was a host-side pure-Python sweep doing
        hundreds of thousands of ``_orient2d`` calls while the device did almost nothing. Porting
        that sweep to a single-thread Warp **CPU** kernel took an order of magnitude off it. The CPU
        device is not a concession: the identical sweep is two orders of magnitude cheaper on one
        CPU thread than on one **CUDA** thread, so a single GPU thread is the wrong tool.

        **The flip loop**, which then dominated the small row. Its cost was not the launch count
        the first reading blamed: most of the host time per pass went to
        [`face_adjacency`][triwarp.adjacency.face_adjacency] and to a *second* radix sort of the
        same edge keys ``face_adjacency`` had already sorted internally, against a fraction of that
        in device work for the whole loop. Since a flip leaves the vertex, face and interior-edge
        counts alone, that whole working set is invariant and is built once into fixed buffers by
        one sort and five launches -- worth about 2x at the large end and more at the small one.
        See [`delaunay_triangulation`][triwarp.reconstruction.delaunay_triangulation].

    The three implementations answer the same question by different means: triwarp seeds a
    sequential lexicographic incremental triangulation and then drives its **parallel** edge-flip
    loop to the empty-circumcircle fixed point, scipy calls Qhull, and VTK runs
    ``vtkDelaunay2D``'s serial insertion. The answers agree on the interior and differ only in hull
    slivers -- pyvista's 374 triangles are a strict *subset* of triwarp's 384 on a 200-point cloud
    (``tests/test_reconstruction.py``), so read the counts as well as the clock.

    """
    Sample the signed distance field on a grid and march it: the one **cubic** group in the suite.

    Both rows get the identical absolute cell size, derived from the mesh's own bounding-box
    diagonal on the host so neither side computes its own. The pair is a slope check: halving the
    cell is 8x the lattice on both sides, and triwarp rises only slightly for it, so the field
    evaluation is *not* what dominates and the fixed marching and cleanup passes are. MeshLab is
    sublinear over the same step too. Read a regression here as the slope steepening rather than the
    absolute number moving.

    MeshLab's ``offset`` parameter is passed as ``PureValue(0.0)``: as a ``PercentageValue`` it runs
    from full erosion at 0% to full dilation at 100%, so its own 50% default is the *zero* offset
    and ``PercentageValue(0)`` would erode the mesh away.

    **libigl's ``offset_surface`` is the same operation at ``isolevel=0``** -- sample the signed
    distance field on a grid, march it -- and its ``signed_distance_type`` is given
    ``PSEUDONORMAL``, the mode ``tests/test_proximity.py`` establishes agrees with triwarp's default
    sign to 8e-8. Its resolution parameter ``s`` is a *cell count along the longest axis*, not a
    length, so it receives ``round(longest_extent / voxel_size)`` -- the named transform that puts
    all three rows on the identical lattice. In-harness it is sublinear in the lattice like the
    other two and needs no cap of its own beyond the group's.
