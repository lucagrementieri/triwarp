"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.boundary.boundary_loops``.

Axis: **loops**. Boundary extraction is not driven by mesh size -- ``sphere_med`` has 81 920 faces
and no boundary at all, and costs less than the 1 024-face ``rim_short``. What it is driven by is
the *shape* of the boundary, along two independent directions that the axis separates:

- **loop length** decides the ranking work. ``rim_long``'s two rims of 65 536 vertices are the
  asymptotic case: a per-vertex successor walk is O(L^2) on a loop of length L, while the Wyllie
  pointer jumping the implementation uses is O(L log L), one kernel launch per round.
- **loop count** decides the host work. Each loop used to cost a slice of a read-back offset table
  plus its own ``wp.clone``, so ``holes_many``'s 512 three-vertex loops were *more* expensive than
  ``rim_long``'s two enormous ones despite carrying a quarter of the boundary vertices.

Measured medians (RTX 5090, ``--device=cuda``): **0.35 / 2.4 / 4.1 ms** for no boundary / two long
rims / 512 short loops. The spread over an unchanged face count is the point, and it is what said
the per-loop host sequence was the thing to batch rather than the ranking: this group read
0.38 / 3.4 / 12.2 ms -- a 32x spread with the *wrong* end on top -- before ``boundary_loops`` became
a slicing wrapper over the packed ``boundary_loops_batched``, which extracts every loop in one pass
and hands back views instead of ``k`` clones.

References
----------
**trimesh**'s ``Trimesh.outline()`` is the equivalent and is rebuilt inside the timed callable,
since it caches its internals on the mesh. **libigl**'s ``boundary_loop`` returns only the longest
loop, so it is doing strictly less work on ``holes_many`` -- noted rather than corrected, because
the alternative is not comparing against it at all.

**open3d** has no boundary-loop extraction: it can report *which* edges are boundary edges
(``get_non_manifold_edges(allow_boundary_edges=False)``) but never orders them into loops, which is
the whole cost of this function.

**pymeshlab** is in the same position and appears in the ``boundary_edges`` group only:
``compute_selection_from_mesh_border`` marks the boundary *vertices* as a bool selection array,
which is the same find-the-boundary pass stopped one step short of an edge list -- and it has
nothing that orders the result into loops either. It is read-only apart from the selection bit, so
it shares the MeshSet.

    Ranking plus batched extraction, across no boundary / two long rims / many short loops.

    The four references return four different things and only triwarp returns every loop as an
    ordered vertex list: ``igl.boundary_loop`` gives the longest loop alone, ``Trimesh.outline()``
    gives a ``Path3D``, and meshlib gives one ``EdgeId`` per hole that the caller must walk. The
    meshlib row therefore includes the ``getLeftRing`` walk, without which it would be timing
    hole *detection* only and would not be the same quantity -- but the walk is a Python loop over
    the ring, so read the row as an upper bound on MeshLib's own cost rather than as its floor.
    The mesh is built inside the timed callable because the ring walk is the first thing to touch
    the topology's edge structure, which is lazily built and cached like the AABB tree.

    The unordered predecessor of ``boundary_loops``: the edge sort without the ranking.

    Subtracting this group from ``boundary_loops`` separates the two costs, which is what says
    whether a regression is in the sort (scales with faces) or in the loop extraction (scales with
    loop count). It reads flat at ~0.4-0.5 ms across the whole axis, so everything above it in
    ``boundary_loops`` is ranking and extraction.

    ``igl.boundary_facets`` is the one reference here that returns the same *thing* triwarp does --
    an ``(n_boundary, 2)`` edge list, plus the incident face and corner indices as second and third
    returns, which is strictly more than triwarp's two columns. It is the right row for this group
