"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.proximity`` hot paths.

Covers winding number, signed distance, tangent spheres and geodesic-ball queries. The AABB
reduction moved to [`test_bounds.py`](test_bounds.py), where ``triwarp.bounds`` lives.
``winding_number`` is O(n_queries x n_faces) even in the tiled variant, so ``lucy`` is skipped;
the pinned serial (``tiled=False``) path is additionally capped at ``bunny`` because one thread
per query walking every face takes minutes beyond that.

Read ``winding_number`` and ``signed_distance_on_mesh[winding]`` together: both answer an
inside/outside question from solid angle, but the first accumulates it exactly over every face while
the second lets Warp's BVH traversal approximate it and keeps only the sign. The gap between them is
the cost of needing the winding *value* rather than just its sign.

Open3D has no equivalent for anything in this module: it has no
generalized winding number — its inside/outside test is raycasting-based
(``RaycastingScene.compute_occupancy``), a different algorithm answering a coarser question — and no
tangent-sphere, local-thickness or geodesic-ball query at all.

``signed_distance_on_mesh`` has **two** references, and they are the only two that exist: libigl's
``igl.signed_distance``, whose ``sign_type`` axis maps onto triwarp's ``sign_mode`` one-for-one, and
pymeshlab's, whose sign rule is a third algorithm and therefore appears once. See
``test_signed_distance_on_mesh`` for the igl mapping and its numbers.

**One thing libigl's signed distance does that no assert may ignore:** for both winding-based sign
types it returns ``(1 - 2w) * d`` rather than ``sign(1 - 2w) * d``, with ``w`` the *continuous*
winding number. So its magnitude is only ``|d|`` where ``w`` is exactly 0 or 1, and near the surface
it is scaled down — measured on ``bunny_decimated``, ``|S|`` deviates from the pseudonormal type's
by **2.7e-2 of the bbox diagonal** for both ``WINDING_NUMBER`` and ``FAST_WINDING_NUMBER``, while
the pseudonormal type agrees with triwarp to **8e-8**. That is why the parity oracle in
``tests/test_proximity.py`` is the pseudonormal type and why the winding row here is a *cost*
comparison only.

**And the Barnes-Hut approximation does pay**, which is worth recording because a 5 000-query probe
had suggested otherwise. At this module's 10 000 queries on ``bunny``, ``igl.fast_winding_number``
is **76.5 ms against ``igl.winding_number``'s 272.5** (25.1 against 65.5 on ``bunny_decimated``) —
3.6x and 2.6x — for a maximum winding deviation of 0.004. It is not a row of its own because triwarp
exposes no approximate-winding entry point to put on the other side of it (``winding_number`` is the
exact sum; the Barnes-Hut walk exists only inside
``signed_distance_on_mesh(sign_mode="winding")``), but it is the number to weigh a fast-winding port
against.

``compute_scalar_by_distance_from_another_mesh_per_vertex(signeddist=True)`` (MeshLab's Distance
from Reference Mesh) measures every vertex of one mesh against another, so the query points go in as
a second, face-less mesh and the answer comes back on their vertex scalar attribute. Three things to
read its row against:

- **Its sign is a third algorithm.** MeshLab takes the dot product with the reference normal at the
  closest point — neither triwarp's 5-ray parity test nor its Barnes-Hut winding accumulation. So it
  appears once rather than twice, in the ``parity`` row.
- **Its per-query cost grows with the reference mesh.** At a fixed 10 000 queries it costs
  **206 / 627 / 7 678 ms** on bunny_decimated / bunny / dragon — 20, 63 and 768 µs per query — while
  being cleanly linear in the query count at a fixed mesh (69 ms at 1 k, 642 at 10 k, 6 125 at 100 k
  on bunny). A closest-point query that is *not* sublinear in the face count is the opposite of what
  triwarp's BVH does — measured **95x** and **235x** against it on bunny_decimated and bunny, a
  ratio that widens with the mesh — which is why it is capped at ``bunny`` with ``rounds=3`` rather
  than allowed to spend 85 s on dragon.
- It writes only the vertex scalar, so the two-mesh MeshSet is built once and shared.

``shape_diameter`` is the one group in this module whose reference is *not* faster than a
millisecond and not close either: ``compute_scalar_by_shape_diameter_function_per_vertex`` is the
most expensive per-vertex filter MeshLab ships (674 ms on ``bunny``), because it traces 64 rays from
every vertex on one core. That is exactly the shape of work a GPU should win outright, which is why
the port exists. Two caveats for reading its row: its ``cone_amplitude`` parameter is a **no-op** in
the 2025.07 build (byte-identical output at 90 and 120 degrees), so its cone is whatever it is, and
it writes only the vertex scalar, so the MeshSet is shared. The ``rays`` sweep is the axis, not the
mesh: the cost is exactly linear in it on both sides, and the pair pins that.

    Exact winding number: no BVH, every query sums over every face.

    the mesh by the registry and the query count here. A 10x step in queries that is not a 10x
    step in time would mean the launch is not saturating the device.

    **pyvista answers the reduced question**: ``select_interior_points`` returns the inside/outside
    *bool* rather than the winding number itself, which is what ``ray.contains_points`` returns and
    what it is compared against (agreement 1.000 on 2 000 queries, ``tests/test_ray.py``). Read its
    row as the cost of the predicate, not of the number -- and note it uses a BVH where this group's
    two other rows deliberately do not.

    Its ``check_surface=False`` is **required, not a shortcut**: the filter validates first and
    raises ``RuntimeError: Surface is not closed`` on every scan mesh in the registry --
    ``bunny_decimated`` has 273 open edges and ``bunny`` 223 -- so with the check on there is no
    mesh here the row can run at all. Disabling it times the ray casting itself (156 / 296 ms per
    10 000 queries on those two), which is the comparable work; the *answer* on an open surface is
    undefined by VTK's own documentation, which is why the value comparison lives in
    ``tests/test_ray.py`` on a closed fixture and this row asserts only the shape.

    **meshlib answers a Barnes-Hut approximation of it**, and that is the whole reason its row is
    interesting here: ``FastWindingNumber(mesh).calcFromVector`` walks the mesh's AABB tree and
    replaces a distant subtree by a dipole, so unlike triwarp's and igl's rows it is *not*
    ``O(queries x faces)`` and should not follow the product. ``beta=20`` is the accuracy at which
    it agrees with the exact sum to 1e-05 (``tests/test_proximity.py``); its own default of 2 is 24x
    looser, so a row at the default would be timing a coarser answer. The tree build is inside the
    timed callable because ``FastWindingNumber`` is constructed per call, which is the same
    no-hoisting situation igl's AABB tree and triwarp's ``wp.Mesh`` are in.

    The unsigned closest-point query, without the sign work the group below pays for.

    Read against ``signed_distance_on_mesh``: both walk a BVH to the nearest triangle, and the
    difference between the two groups is what signing costs -- five perturbed parity rays or a
    winding traversal on triwarp's side, a projection-normal test on MeshLib's. That comparison is
    the reason this group exists separately rather than being folded into the signed one.

    meshlib's batched form is ``PointsToMeshProjector``: ``updateMeshData`` hands it the mesh and
    ``findProjections`` fills a ``std_vector_MeshProjectionResult``. The per-query
    ``findProjection`` free function gives identical distances (``tests/test_proximity.py``) but
    would time a Python loop. The mesh is built and the AABB tree pre-warmed outside the timed
    callable, so the row prices the traversal -- the ``new_mesh_ml`` rule for a query row.

    Two ways to crash this call rather than get an exception, both measured. ``upDistLimitSq`` must
    be ``FLT_MAX``, not ``inf`` -- an infinite limit segfaults inside ``findProjections``. And
    **the projector keeps a raw pointer to the mesh it was given**, so
    ``updateMeshData(build_a_mesh())`` on a temporary leaves it reading freed memory and crashes on
    a cloud this size; the mesh has to be held in a name that outlives every query, which is
    Open3D's ``from_legacy`` hazard in a second library.

    pyvista's ``find_closest_cell`` is the third batched form of the same query, through a
    ``vtkStaticCellLocator``. It is the most *accurate* reference in the group -- against
    ``igl.point_mesh_squared_distance`` it agrees to 4.4e-16 on both the distance and the point --
    but it returns the closest **point** and the cell, never the distance, so its row is that much
    wider than what it is timed against and the subtraction stays out of the timed callable. Its
    locator is built lazily and cached on the ``PolyData``, so it is pre-warmed here rather than
    timed, the same rule MeshLib's AABB tree gets above.

    **The per-query cost is not flat in the mesh, and the knee is between 1 M and 28 M faces.**
    This group holds its query count fixed, so the effect shows up in a *caller* instead --
    ``mesh_to_mesh_distance``, which used to derive its bound by querying at every vertex of one
    mesh. Measured there, with the ``wp.Mesh`` build separated out: **26.5 ns** per query at 36k
    queries against ``bunny``, **5.4** at 438k / ``dragon``, **10.2** at 544k / ``happy_buddha`` and
    **58.3** at 14 M / ``lucy`` -- while the build itself stays linear (0.26 / 0.97 / 1.05 /
    31.61 ms). The first number is launch overhead at a small dim; the last is a cache cliff, the
    BVH having stopped fitting. It is worth knowing before reading any large-mesh row that ends in a
    closest-point query as an algorithm result.

    That cliff is why the caller no longer queries every vertex: 14 M of them cost 93 % of its call
    to prune a traversal worth 0.8 % of it, and a subsample bounds the answer just as soundly
    (``proximity._BOUND_SAMPLE_TARGET`` carries the sweep). This group is the one that still prices
    the unsampled query, which is what keeps that cliff visible.

    triangle mesh BVH -- and the edge set is far smaller than the face set, so the ratio prices
    triwarp's hand-written deepening traversal against Warp's built-in one on an easier input.

    The crease set is built outside the timed callable and on the host, so both rows get the
    identical edge set (see ``_crease_edges_np``); it is the *input* here, and triwarp's own
    ``crease_edges`` is timed in ``test_seams.py``. Its size is a mesh property rather than a knob,
    which is why this group takes no axis of its own.

    pyvista is the only batched reference. VTK's ``find_closest_cell`` on a one-line-cell-per-edge
    ``PolyData`` is exact for this query (probed: 0.0 distance error, every cell id matching a
    brute-force argmin), and its locator is pre-warmed rather than timed, as in the surface group.
    MeshLib's ``findProjectionOnMeshEdges`` is the other exact reference and is deliberately absent:
    it answers one query per call, so a row would time a Python loop over 10 000 queries rather than
    the traversal (``tests/test_proximity.py`` carries it as a ``benchmarked=False`` claim).

    ``bunny`` against pyvista's **68.3** (23x), and 12.1 / 32.2 / 89.9 ms at ``dragon`` /

    number to read it against is ``closest_point_on_mesh``'s **2.21 ms** on the same queries and
    the same mesh: this query is **1.33x slower over a set ~30x smaller**, so the hand-written
    deepening loop is
    losing to Warp's built-in mesh traversal rather than to the geometry. A query far from every
    crease pays several empty scans before the radius reaches anything, which is where that gap
    lives and what a future ``initial_radius`` estimate (the k-NN path already has one) would close.

    The two sign modes, on the same closest-point query.

    ``"winding"`` walks the BVH accumulating solid angle (Barnes-Hut, ``accuracy=2.0``) instead of
    casting 5 perturbed parity rays, and needs a ``wp.Mesh`` carrying the per-node solid-angle
    expansion — so the ``wp.Mesh`` build inside the timed region differs between the two, which is
    intentional: it is part of what the mode costs. Both include that build because
    ``signed_distance_on_mesh`` constructs its own mesh (it takes vertex/face arrays, not a
    ``wp.Mesh``), so there is no way for a caller to hoist it.

    **libigl is the only reference whose sign axis maps onto both of triwarp's modes**, which is
    why it appears twice where pymeshlab appears once: ``SIGNED_DISTANCE_TYPE_PSEUDONORMAL``
    against ``"parity"`` and ``SIGNED_DISTANCE_TYPE_FAST_WINDING_NUMBER`` against ``"winding"`` —
    the second is the same Barnes-Hut family triwarp's mode is. Its AABB tree is built per call, as
    triwarp's ``wp.Mesh`` is, and it gets ``rounds=3`` like the pymeshlab row.

    **open3d's row is Embree**: ``RaycastingScene.compute_signed_distance`` signs by ray parity, so
    it pairs with ``"parity"`` only, and it shares triwarp's sign convention exactly (negative
    inside; probed to 1.8e-7 agreement on an icosphere before the row landed). The scene build sits
    inside the timed callable for the same no-hoisting reason triwarp's ``wp.Mesh`` build does.

    **pyvista's row is an exact SDF and the closest match in the set**:
    ``compute_implicit_distance`` (``vtkImplicitPolyDataDistance``) shares triwarp's sign convention
    -- negative inside -- and agrees to 1.5e-07 with a correlation of 1.0000000 and identical signs
    on 2 000 queries, which is why it is the parity oracle for this group. One row only: it has a
    single sign rule.

    In-harness medians at 10 000 queries, igl rows run in isolation: **64 / 150 ms on
    ``bunny_decimated`` and 394 / 520 on ``bunny``** against triwarp's 6.3 / 6.6 and 4.3 / 4.0 — so
    10-100x, and note that **the mode ratio disagrees between the two sides**: igl's winding sign
    costs 2.3x its pseudonormal one where triwarp's two modes are within 1.3x of each other,
    because the solid-angle walk rides the BVH traversal triwarp is already doing. Read igl's
    *medians* here, not its minima: the pseudonormal row spreads 225-399 ms on ``bunny``.

    whose Delaunay triangulation is equilateral throughout, swept over three sizes. The lattice
    is not arbitrary. Any Delaunay of a bounded point set has needle triangles on its hull, and
    a query within float32 noise of two needles' shared edge resolves to neither, so a random-

    a like-for-like split; scipy is doing strictly less work per call.

    pyvista's ``find_containing_cell`` is in scipy's position rather than triwarp's: its locator is

    It locates in **3-D** -- the lattice and the queries get a zero ``z`` -- and it is the only

    Clearance between a mesh and a translated copy of itself, at two separations.

    The **separation is the axis**, and the direction it runs in was a surprise worth recording.
    The bound derived from the vertex query grows with the gap, so each face's query box grows with
    it -- which predicts that a distant pair is the expensive one. Measured, it is the **cheap**
    one: 8.78 ms against 12.89 on ``bunny``, and 5.32 against 11.46 on ``dragon``. Once the
    running
    minimum prunes by box-to-box gap, a large true clearance means almost every candidate is
    rejected on that lower bound immediately, while a tight clearance leaves many pairs genuinely
    close and each one has to be measured.

    meshlib's ``findDistance`` is a BVH-versus-BVH descent with a running bound, which prunes with
    information this two-phase form only has once the second phase starts; and it is multi-threaded.
    So this is the row where a sequential-pruning algorithm is expected to compete well against a
    wavefront, which the plan predicted up front (§13's CUDA-decided judgement: record the ratio and
    keep it). Both rows build their own acceleration structure inside the callable.

    First measurement, medians on an RTX 5090, near / far:

    | mesh | faces | triwarp-cuda | meshlib |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | ``bunny_decimated`` | 39 993 | 7.71 / 4.46 ms | **0.36 / 0.37** (21.7x / 12.0x) |
    | ``bunny`` | 69 630 | 12.89 / 8.78 ms | **1.13 / 1.46** (11.4x / 6.0x) |
    | ``dragon`` | 871 414 | 11.46 / 5.32 ms | (capped) |
    | ``happy_buddha`` | 1 087 716 | 7.90 / 7.25 ms | (capped) |
    | ``lucy`` | | 882.8 / 795.9 ms | (capped) |

    Two things that table says. It is **nearly flat in the face count up to ~1 M** -- 40k costs more
    than 871k -- so over that range the cost is the candidate count, not the mesh;
    ``bunny_decimated`` is the slowest per face because its 87 duplicated faces manufacture
    near-zero-gap candidates that no bound can prune. And the two prunes inside the kernel are what
    make the numbers reportable at all: without them the same rows read 144.6 / 252.3 ms on
    ``bunny``, so they are worth **11.2x** near and **29.1x** far.

    **``lucy`` is not flat and the reason is a different function.** 26x ``happy_buddha``'s faces
    costs 114x the time, and attributed per stage that is almost entirely the *bound*, not this
    group's own query:

    | stage | ``bunny`` near | ``happy_buddha`` near | ``lucy`` near |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | ``closest_point_on_mesh`` (the bound) | 1.19 ms | **6.50** | **840.22** |
    | ``face_aabb_bounds`` | 0.03 | 0.03 | 0.83 |
    | ``bvh_from_bounds`` | 0.23 | 1.04 | 30.77 |
    | ``face_to_mesh_distance`` (the query) | **8.29** | 0.40 | 94.57 |

    Inside that bound the ``wp.Mesh`` build is linear (0.26 / 0.97 / 1.05 / 31.61 ms across
    ``bunny`` / ``dragon`` / ``happy_buddha`` / ``lucy``) and the **queries** are the cliff: 26.5 ns
    each at 36k queries, 5.4 at 438k, 10.2 at 544k and **58.3 at 14 M**, a 5.7x rise per query once
    the BVH stops fitting in cache. So the superlinearity belongs to ``closest_point_on_mesh``, is a
    memory-hierarchy effect rather than an algorithm defect, and is *not* the thing a
    BVH-versus-BVH rewrite of this function would fix.

    **The stage split inverts with size, which is where any future work has to be aimed.** The query
    dominates exactly where the gap is -- the ``bunny_decimated`` and ``bunny`` rows, the only ones
    meshlib is not capped out of -- and by ``happy_buddha`` the bound is 74 % of the call and the
    query is 0.40 ms. So a cheaper bound (a subsampled vertex query is still sound: the minimum over
    any *subset* of A's vertices is still an upper bound on the surface distance) only moves rows
    that contribute no gap, and a faster query only moves the small ones.

    **The query half has since been done, and it was a load-balancing problem rather than the
    pruning problem it read as.** Counted on ``bunny``: the broad phase makes 2.01 M candidate
    tests of which **0.16 %** survive the box prune, so the leaf test is not the cost -- but
    **98.2 %** of query faces return no candidate at all, 0.5 % carry half the traversal, and the
    busiest face walks **3 428** candidates alone. The walk now runs as a capped thread pass plus a
    warp per straggler (``proximity._QUERY_CANDIDATE_CAP``), worth **3.1-10.2x** end to end on the
    four rows here with the distance and ``face_a`` identical. Two levers were measured and
    declined on the way: ``block_dim`` (256, the default, wins at every value from 32) and
    tightening the query margin -- the vertex bound *is* the answer to all 16 digits on all four
    rows, so there is nothing to tighten and the query is confirming a distance the bound already
    found.

    A BVH-pair wavefront remains the one change that would also delete the bound phase, and it is
    **larger than it looks**: Warp exposes ``bvh_query_aabb`` / ``bvh_query_ray`` and no
    node-by-node traversal, so a pair descent means building our own hierarchy rather than
    reusing ``wp.Bvh``.
