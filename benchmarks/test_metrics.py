"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.metrics``: the differentiable Chamfer loss and the plain metrics.

Cloud/mesh B is the same mesh translated by 5% of its bbox diagonal (untimed setup), so both
directions of every symmetric metric do real work.

Differentiable case
-------------------
``chamfer_mesh_to_mesh_loss`` carries ``requires_grad=True`` on both vertex buffers; each timed
round records a fresh tape, runs backward and zeroes the gradients, which is the real
optimization-loop cost. It is triwarp-only: open3d has no autodiff, so timing forward-only against
forward-plus-backward would be a misleading ratio rather than a useful baseline.

Non-differentiable cases
------------------------
``chamfer_points_to_points`` and ``hausdorff_points_to_points`` are each **two**
[`query_nearest`][triwarp.neighbors.query_nearest] calls at ``k=1`` plus a
reduction, so they are the direct measurement for a change to the k-NN kernel — the same kernel
that sits under all twelve of ``distance.py``'s nearest-neighbour call sites.

**open3d** is the reference: ``PointCloud.compute_point_cloud_distance`` returns exactly the forward
nearest-neighbour Euclidean distances (a serial ``KDTreeFlann`` search), from which both metrics
follow — Chamfer as the mean of the squares in each direction (the pytorch3d convention triwarp
uses), Hausdorff as the overall maximum. Both baselines therefore run the same two searches triwarp
does, and the host-side ``numpy`` reduction over the returned vector is inside the timed region
because open3d has no device-side equivalent to hide it behind.

**pymeshlab**'s ``get_hausdorff_distance`` is the second reference for the Hausdorff group, and it
returns ``{min, max, mean, RMS, n_samples, ...}`` in one call. Two parameters decide whether the row
means anything: it samples **one** layer and searches the other, so it is one-directional and the
symmetric answer needs both calls (both are timed); and ``samplenum`` defaults to **8**, so
``samplevert=True`` with ``samplenum`` set to the full cloud size is what makes it sample every
point instead of measuring almost nothing. It has no Chamfer entry point -- the mean of the squares
is not among the statistics it returns -- so it appears in the Hausdorff group alone.

trimesh and libigl have no point-cloud Chamfer/Hausdorff entry point (``igl.hausdorff`` is
mesh-to-mesh only and is already the documented reference for
[`hausdorff_mesh_to_mesh`][triwarp.metrics.hausdorff_mesh_to_mesh] in ``tests/``), so neither
appears here.

    the legacy ``o3d.geometry`` baselines the rest of this suite uses; mixing the two in one table
    would compare implementations, not libraries.
