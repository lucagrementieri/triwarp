"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.graph``: connected components and the weighted envelope.

Two axes, matching the two ways a graph algorithm gets slow:

* **components** for ``connected_component_labels``. ECL-CC is three launches whatever the graph
  looks like, but the pointer-jumping hook/flatten converges at a rate set by component structure,
  so 1 / 64 / 1024 components at a fixed 81 920 faces is the shape that would expose a regression.
  The same two labellings are *also* run on the **diameter** axis, where they must read flat --
  that is a separate claim from the component sweep and it is load-bearing elsewhere in the
  package, so it is regression-covered rather than measured once (see
  ``test_connected_component_labels_depth``).
* **diameter**, for ``shortest_path_envelope`` -- one launch per relaxation pass, and the pass
  count is the diameter of the region that violates the bound. The work per pass sweeps the whole
  CSR rather than a frontier, so there is no narrow-frontier handover to make. Seeded from a single
  spike, the worst case on purpose: the cap has to cross the whole mesh, so read the row as an upper
  bound rather than a typical one. Capped at ``bunny_decimated`` for that reason.

The vertex-adjacency CSR matrix is prebuilt (untimed, cached per mesh/device) so the timings
isolate the graph algorithms from the edge sort that produces them -- including
``shortest_path_envelope``'s length-weighted one, whose weights are ``edges_unique_length``.

``combine.split`` used to live here because it is the other component-count-driven function in the
package. It now sits in [`test_combine.py`](test_combine.py) with the rest of ``triwarp.combine``,
on the same ``components`` axis.

References
----------
The scipy reference sits in the ``scipy`` library slot: ``scipy.sparse.csgraph
.connected_components`` is the labelling oracle for both component groups (and the backend
trimesh itself uses for graph traversals).

Neither **trimesh** nor **open3d** appears: both functions take an abstract CSR adjacency matrix,
and open3d exposes no graph-traversal API over one -- its connectivity work is mesh-bound
(``cluster_connected_triangles``), which is what ``split`` uses over in ``test_combine``.

**libigl does take that argument**, which the paragraph above used to be read as ruling out.
``igl.connected_components`` accepts a ``scipy.sparse`` adjacency matrix directly -- the same
argument ``connected_component_labels`` takes -- and ``igl.facet_components(F)`` is the dual-graph
labelling ``face_connected_component_labels`` computes. So both labellings have a second
implementation and the face one, which had none at all, now has two.

**pymeshlab** answers two groups. ``shortest_path_envelope``'s reference is
``apply_scalar_saturation_per_vertex``, which is the same relaxation read as a Lipschitz cap on a
per-vertex scalar (VCG ``UpdateQuality::VertexSaturate``); its ``gradientthr`` divides the edge
length, so both sides receive the identical weights and the row is apples-to-apples. It needs the
scalar attribute to exist on the MeshSet and mutates it, so that row rebuilds the set inside the
timed callable.

Its other appearance, ``connected_component_labels``, comes with a caveat: it has no filter
that returns a label array. The closest thing that runs the component pass *without* also splitting
or deleting anything is ``compute_selection_by_small_disconnected_components_per_face`` at
``nbfaceratio=0.0`` -- it labels every component and then thresholds against a fraction of the
largest one, selecting nothing. So the row is "label everything, then one threshold pass", against
triwarp's "label everything". The labelling is the only graph work MeshLab exposes.

    or a derived selection, so its cost includes materializing ``k`` bitsets and should be the row
    that moves most across this axis. It reads the topology rather than an assembled adjacency, so
    the mesh is built outside the timed callable exactly as triwarp's CSR is.

    ``igl.connected_components`` is the other label-array reference and the closest match to

    inside the timed callable (``igl.adjacency_matrix`` is the only form it takes), so on this axis
    its row carries the build where scipy's does not; the two are read against triwarp separately

    its component count differs from the others on a mesh with unreferenced vertices while the

    the dual-graph construction *and* the labelling, so a reference handed a prebuilt matrix would
