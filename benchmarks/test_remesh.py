"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.remesh``.

Three axes, because the four entry points fail to scale for three different reasons:

* ``subdivide`` on the **scan sweep** — exactly 4x the faces, one pass, no data dependence. The
  module's throughput baseline and the only group a face count fully explains.
* ``subdivide_to_size`` on **scale**, sweeping ``max_edge`` — output grows as
  ``(L_max / max_edge) ** 2`` while the *pass count* grows only as ``log2(L_max / max_edge)``, so
  halving the target is roughly four times the output for one extra pass. Edge-length *variance*
  matters too: one long edge forces another pass over the whole mesh.
* ``flip_to_delaunay`` and ``isotropic_remesh`` on **quality** — the iterative paths, where the
  round count is set by how far the input is from the fixed point rather than by its size.
  ``saddle_graded`` exists for exactly this: identical connectivity to ``saddle``, worst aspect
  ratio 4 719 against 1.6, so it is badly non-Delaunay and full of slivers while ``saddle`` is
  nearly converged. A near-Delaunay mesh flips in one or two rounds; a bad one runs all
  ``max_iter``.

Sizing comes from the mesh's own mean edge length (computed once from the NumPy source so every
library gets the *same* target), which keeps the work proportional to the mesh rather than to an
absolute length that would explode on one and no-op on another. ``flip_to_delaunay`` mutates its
face buffer in place, so the timed callable clones it — one device copy, negligible against the
passes it feeds.

References
----------
``subdivide`` has an exact open3d equivalent in ``subdivide_midpoint(1)`` (same 1:4 split, and it
returns a new mesh so the shared one is reusable) and a trimesh one; ``subdivide_to_size`` has a
trimesh counterpart. Open3D has no edge-flip pass and no isotropic remesher, and its
``subdivide_midpoint`` takes an iteration count rather than a length target so it cannot split
adaptively. trimesh has neither iterative path.

**pymeshlab** is the *only* reference ``isotropic_remesh`` has, and an unusually close one:
``meshing_isotropic_explicit_remeshing`` runs the same five stages in the same order (refine,
collapse, edge-swap, Laplacian relax, reproject), each individually switchable, so the comparison is
stage-for-stage. Two differences are left in place — it preserves crease edges above
``featuredeg=30`` and its ``checksurfdist`` default rejects any local operation deviating more than
1 % of the bbox diagonal — because turning them off would measure a filter no MeshLab user runs.
Triwarp's counterpart to the second (``max_deviation``) is deliberately **not** passed: at
MeshLab's own 1 % default it is byte-identically a no-op on both fixtures, so passing it would buy
a per-iteration closest-point pass and no change in output.

It also covers ``subdivide_to_size`` through
``meshing_surface_subdivision_midpoint(threshold=...)``, which lands on the identical output face
count. It cannot cover the uniform ``subdivide`` group, and the reason is a hard failure rather than
a slow row: **midpoint subdivision raises** ``Mesh has some not 2 manifold faces`` on every scan
mesh — the same boundary the libigl and potpourri3d references hit — so the midpoint reference lives
on the ``scale`` axis with ``subdivide_to_size``.

``flip_by_objective`` joins ``flip_to_delaunay`` on **quality** because it is the same engine with a
different predicate, so the pair isolates what the predicate costs from what the flip machinery
costs. The two objectives behave differently there by construction: the planarity one refuses any
quad that is not flat and so converges in one pass on a curved input, where the curvature one has
work everywhere. MeshLab's ``meshing_edge_flip_by_planar_optimization`` is the reference for the
first, at the same ``pthreshold`` and ``planartype``; it rewrites the topology, so that row rebuilds
the MeshSet.

``quadric_decimate`` pairs with ``cluster_decimate`` because they solve one problem with opposite
structures: clustering is three data-independent passes, the quadric method an iterated greedy loop
whose pass count depends on how contested the rings are — exactly what triangle shape changes. All
three serial references are here (``igl.decimate``, open3d, pymeshlab), the best-referenced port in
the package. Note MeshLab's filter defaults to ``autoclean=True`` and deletes unreferenced vertices,
so its MeshSet is rebuilt per round; and the *quality* comparison lives in ``tests/test_remesh.py``,
where triwarp measures a **lower** Hausdorff error than all three at the same face count.

**Triwarp was long the slower one on that group, and the reason is the pass count rather than the
per-pass work**: one hashed-key independent set commits a small fraction of the candidates, so
reaching a tenth of the faces takes tens of passes, each paying a full edge/adjacency/quadric
rebuild plus two radix sorts that a serial queue pays none of. Committing **several** independent
sets against one rebuild closed part of it (see ``_QUADRIC_RATIOS`` for that and for what the other
candidate lever was worth) and capturing the pass closed the rest.

``cluster_decimate`` is the other **scan sweep** group and the interesting one to read against
``subdivide``: the same shape of work in reverse (bin, remap, dedup — no data dependence, no
iteration), so if the two do not scale alike something is wrong with one. Both open3d and pymeshlab
are references, and the open3d one is *exact* — same grid anchor, same cell means, identical face
count — which is rare enough here to be worth stating. Cell width is a fraction of the mean edge
length so the ratio is comparable across meshes.

Caps: ``isotropic_remesh`` stops at ``bunny`` on the scan sweep (it is an order of magnitude dearer
on ``dragon`` and would dominate the suite); the split paths stop at ``dragon`` because a 1:4
subdivision of ``happy_buddha`` / ``lucy`` does not fit a sane memory budget; the ``trimesh``
reference for ``subdivide_to_size`` stops at ``bunny`` for a ratio the smaller meshes already
establish, and the pymeshlab one skips ``sphere_large`` for the same reason.

    Exactly 4x the faces in one pass: the module's clean throughput baseline.

    Both references differ from triwarp only in the output *ordering*, which is what makes the
    parity comparison a centroid match rather than an array compare (``tests/test_remesh.py``).

    !!! warning "``igl.upsample`` is memory-unsafe on the scan meshes and is deliberately absent"
        It is midpoint 1:4 subdivision with triwarp's semantics exactly, so it *should* be the
        widest reference agreement in the module -- but on a scan mesh it corrupts the process heap
        and takes the whole pytest session down with a SIGSEGV, which loses every other row in this
        module because ``--benchmark-json`` is only written at session end.

        One selection per process: the igl rows crash some of the time with no other library in the
        selection at all and *every* time with the other libraries present, and per mesh almost
        always on the two small meshes and never on the largest. So it is not an interaction with
        triwarp, and it is not a size limit -- the *smallest* mesh fails most and the largest never
        does. Compacting the unreferenced vertices away makes it worse, so there is nothing to pass
        it that makes it safe. This is the third memory-unsafe binding in this wheel, alongside
        ``igl.loop`` and ``igl.in_element``; see the libigl hazards in ``.claude/CLAUDE.md`` section
        7.6. It stays a *tested* reference on the small clean ``icosahedron`` fixture, where it is
        reliable.

    **pytorch3d** is the third reference and the only GPU one. ``SubdivideMeshes()`` is constructed
    *inside* the timed callable on purpose: passing a mesh to its constructor caches the subdivision
    topology and every later call reuses it, which would time a gather rather than a subdivision --
    and triwarp's row rebuilds everything each call. It agrees with triwarp on sorted coordinates
    exactly, so like the other two it differs only in output ordering. The row carries its
    ``Meshes`` build, which is cheap next to a 4x face expansion.

    Loop subdivision: the same 1:4 split as ``subdivide``, with smooth stencils not midpoints.

    Read against ``subdivide`` above, which does identical topology work and returns the same output
    size: the gap between them is the cost of the stencils alone -- two extra atomic accumulation
    passes (per-edge opposite vertices, per-vertex ring sums) and two position kernels over grids
    the midpoint split never visits. The two groups sit on different axes for the reason below, so
    compare per-triangle throughput rather than raw medians.

    ``igl.loop`` and Open3D's ``subdivide_loop`` are the same variant as triwarp -- the two agree
    with each other to 2e-16 on the relocated originals, all three using **Warren's** ``beta``
    (``3/(8k)``, ``3/16`` at ``k = 3``). ``igl.loop``'s ``number_of_subdivs`` stays at 1, which is
    one triwarp call. Both references take ``rounds=3``.

    **This group is on the ``scale`` axis, not the scan sweep, because ``igl.loop`` cannot survive
    the scan meshes.** With no Warp in the process it aborts with ``free(): invalid pointer`` on a
    five-vertex mesh with three faces on one edge, and SIGSEGVs on ``bunny_decimated``, whose
    duplicated faces leave it not edge-manifold. On ``bunny`` it does return, with silent ``NaN``
    rows -- one per unreferenced vertex, since ``igl::adjacency_list`` is sized ``F.max() + 1``
    where ``igl::loop`` indexes it to ``n_verts``. That is exactly the hazard the ``scale`` axis
    exists for.

    ``trimesh.remesh.subdivide_loop`` gets no row either, for two independent reasons: it uses
    Loop's *original* trigonometric ``beta``, which agrees with Warren's exactly at valence 6 and
    differs elsewhere, so it could not be a parity oracle; and it divides by the neighbour count, so
    its own ``assert np.isfinite`` fails on any mesh with an unreferenced vertex. triwarp keeps an
    unreferenced vertex where it is and has no stencil that can divide by zero, which is why its row
    is the one that asserts finiteness.

    Liepa's density criterion instead of a target edge length, on the axis it exists for.

    The ``quality`` axis is the one that separates the two refiners: ``saddle`` and
    ``saddle_graded`` have identical vertex counts, face counts and connectivity, and differ only in
    how unevenly the triangles are sized. A target-length refiner does the same work on both -- it
    compares every edge against one number -- where this one compares each triangle against its
    *own* neighbourhood, so the graded row is where its per-vertex scale attribute earns its keep
    and the uniform row is the control.

    The cost is one scan pair plus one kernel per pass, and the split is 1 -> 3 at the centroid, so
    unlike edge bisection there is no crack-free template and no agreement with the neighbours --
    which is what makes the criterion cheap in parallel rather than merely correct.

    There is no reference row. pymeshfix performs this refinement, but only as a stage inside
    ``fill_small_boundaries``, behind a load that is most of the round and cannot be hoisted out of
    it, so a row would price the load;
    ``tests/test_holes.py`` compares the answers instead. pymeshlab's ``refineholeedgelen`` is a

    Five stages x ``iterations``, on a nearly-converged mesh and a badly conditioned one.

    MeshLab runs the identical five stages, and the pair reads in opposite directions: pymeshlab
    spreads several-fold across the axis where triwarp is flat, so a modest win on ``saddle``
    becomes a large one on ``saddle_graded``. MeshLib's own queue is level with triwarp, and its
    unchanged column is what certifies the triwarp row.

    **This is not a like-for-like win, and the timing alone is misleading.** triwarp is flat because
    its loop is a fixed ``iterations`` x five launches whatever the input looks like; MeshLab's
    serial local-operation queue keeps working until the operations stop paying off. Comparing the
    *outputs* at the same iteration count and target length says what the difference buys: on
    ``saddle`` triwarp is past parity on aspect ratio and within a couple of percent of the
    requested length, while on the *graded* patch it misses the target by more and leaves a far
    worse 99th-percentile aspect ratio than MeshLab.

    **The two triwarp rows moved together and for one reason, which is worth stating because the
    graded row got worse.** The collapse stage's parallel independent set locked by the *raw* edge
    index, which ``edges_unique`` orders lexicographically and which is therefore spatially monotone
    on any structured mesh -- so the lock had one local minimum and committed **one** collapse per
    pass out of tens of thousands of candidates, at the same wall clock as the hashed key that
    commits thousands. ``kernels/remesh.py``'s ``scramble_index`` fixes it. It also unmasked the
    smoother defect below, since closed: with collapse finally committing, the graded patch's worst
    triangles got worse rather than better. That is not the key's doing -- at the tests' own target
    the raw key leaves several times more float32-degenerate faces on this mesh than the hashed one
    -- it is what a collapse stage does on anisotropic input when the smoother downstream of it
    cannot see the anisotropy.

    Two bugs were found by reading this pair against the reference, both pre-existing and invisible
    to ``tests/test_remesh.py``, which only ever ran the remesher on clean closed icospheres:

    * The swap stage flipped on the valence objective with only a convexity guard, so on a graded
      mesh
      it turned slivers into worse slivers and in float32 hit exactly-zero area on a few percent of
      them. It now also rejects any flip that would create a degenerate triangle or worsen the
      pair's aspect ratio.
    * ``_smooth_pass`` is now the area-equalizing relaxation this module's Notes promise, weighting
      each
      one-ring neighbour by its barycentric area. It had to be: a regular graded grid is
      valence-perfect, already Delaunay, *and* a fixed point of the unweighted Laplacian, so with
      the plain centroid three of the five stages were blind to its anisotropy by construction and
      only split/collapse acted. The ``cave_cube`` self-intersection that had blocked this was never
      the smoother's -- it was the missing collapse fold veto -- and with that in place the
      weighting lands with no veto of its own needed (one is kept anyway, because it measures free).
      What is left is the stopping rule, which is this group's standing D2 exemption. The whole call
      is also faster, since a better-shaped mesh gives split and collapse less to do.

# dozens of geometry rebuilds of ~40 wrapper calls each, and a rebuild costs the same whatever the
# face count -- so the count of wrapper calls per rebuild is the lever, not the kernels and not the
# mesh. Three things priced against that: hoisting the per-pass allocations is worth a few percent
# at most and was not done (a memset that initializes a kernel input cannot be removed by moving the
# allocation); committing several independent sets per rebuild cuts the rebuild count by roughly the
# round count; and grouping the pass's edges **once**, rather than letting the candidate scoring and
# the feature/boundary classification group the same ``3 * n_faces`` rows three times between them,
# is worth nearly as much again, almost all of it ``_classify``.
#
# What moved it most was **capturing the pass**: the pass body's host readbacks were replaced by the
# scans they were reading, every buffer was fixed at a bound the mesh cannot exceed, and one graph
# is replayed for every pass. Several-fold on top, and it makes triwarp the fastest of the five on
# every cell. See ``remesh._DecimationBuffers``.
#
# **What is left is the graph itself, not the loop around it** (``saddle_graded`` at 0.1, 44 passes,
# measured on a shared box, min of 9 interleaved reps). The replays are ~84 % of the call; replaying
# them back to back with no readback between is within 2 % of the real loop, and CUDA events around
# each replay agree with that to 0.3 %, so the per-pass 4-byte readback bubble is ~2 % of the call
# and moving the pass loop under ``wp.capture_while`` (which needs every allocation in
# ``_issue_pass`` hoisted, since a conditional body may not allocate) is not worth building. A
# replay takes ~1.5x the summed duration of its ~110 kernel, memset and memcpy nodes measured
# uncaptured, so a third of it is inter-node gaps inside the graph: the lever now is fewer nodes
# per pass (fusion inside ``_issue_pass`` and ``_run_collapse_rounds``). The remaining ~14 % is the
# issued pass 0 and the recorded pass 1, which cost about the same as each other and ~3x a replay.
