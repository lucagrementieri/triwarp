"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.levelset``.

Two groups, and both are sized by the **lattice** rather than by a mesh, which is what the module
has in common: ``marching_cubes`` takes a field and no mesh at all, and ``offset_mesh`` turns its
input into a field before doing anything.

``marching_cubes`` is the primitive the other rows here end in, so it is timed on its own first
-- against ``meshlib``'s ``marchingCubes``, the same algorithm on the same case table, which makes
it
one of the suite's cleanest comparisons. Its resolution pair is a slope check rather than a size
sweep; read a regression as the slope steepening, not the absolute number moving. ``thicken_mesh``
has no group: it is a per-vertex extrusion plus a rim band, so it belongs to the mesh-edit cost
family and not to this file's axis -- which is the same reason it is the one member of the module
that is not a level-set operation.

The offset group's axis is likewise the **lattice**, not the mesh. A level-set offset samples a
signed distance at every point of a regular grid and marches it, so its cost is
``resolution ** 3`` closest-point queries plus one marching-cubes pass -- the input's face count
enters only through the BVH descent each query pays. That is why the cell width is the parametrized
axis here and the mesh sweep is along for the ride: doubling the resolution is 8x the queries
whatever the mesh, and a row whose slope is not ~8x is telling you the BVH, not the lattice, is the
cost.

References
----------
**meshlib** ``offsetMesh`` is the same algorithm: an OpenVDB level set at a given ``voxelSize``,
marched back to a mesh. It is the fair row -- both sides sample a field on a lattice of the same
pitch, and ``tests/test_levelset.py`` pins them to within half a cell of each other on the surface
and to within 5 % on the vertex count.

**pymeshlab** ``generate_resampled_uniform_mesh`` is MeshLab's offset and is timed at the same cell
size. Its ``offset`` parameter is passed as ``PureValue``, which is mandatory rather than stylistic:
as a ``PercentageValue`` it runs from full erosion at 0 % to full dilation at 100 %, so its own
default is the *zero* offset (CLAUDE.md section 6).

open3d has no offset, and neither does trimesh or igl: a level-set offset needs a signed distance
field on a lattice, and of the six CPU references only these two build one.

    Outward level-set offset at a matched cell width: field sampling plus one marching-cubes pass.

    Every side gets the identical absolute cell and the identical absolute offset, so the row is a
    comparison of two field-and-march implementations rather than of two parameter conventions. The
    lattice includes the padding the offset needs -- ``ceil(distance / cell) + 2`` cells on every
    side, or the level set is clipped by the boundary -- which at four cells of offset is a
    noticeable fraction of the box and is paid by triwarp's row alone (both references pad
    internally).

    Read the two divisors as a slope. 2x the resolution is **8x the samples**, and triwarp's row
    grows only **2.8x** -- the samples are independent queries, so a lattice this size does not
    saturate the GPU and the wall clock tracks occupancy rather than work. The reference rows grow
    2.2x (meshlib) and 1.6x (pymeshlab) for the same reason on their own cores.

    The topology-preserving shell: two vertex passes and one band, no lattice anywhere.

    Read this against ``offset_mesh`` above -- the two answer the same question and their costs are
    not comparable in kind. This one is linear in the *mesh* (normals, two displacements, a rim
    walk) and produces ``2F + 2E`` triangles; the level-set offset is cubic in the *lattice* and
    produces whatever the marching finds. So the interesting number is the ratio, and it is the
    argument for having both.

    meshlib's ``makeThickMesh`` is the same construction, and ``tests/test_offset.py`` shows just
    how same: identical counts, volumes equal to five decimals, and identical face sets under a
    vertex bijection. That makes this the cleanest row in the module -- two implementations of one
    algorithm, no parameter mapping in between. Its ``ThickenParams`` is built outside the timed
    callable and its mesh is fresh per round, since the call mutates nothing but the params
    object is an input.

    The thickness is 1 % of the bounding-box diagonal, which is small enough that neither side folds
    (the shell would self-intersect past the local curvature radius, and a shell that folds is not
    the same amount of work).

    ``sphere_med`` / ``sphere_large`` -- flat, because at these sizes it is three launches against
    the launch floor -- against meshlib's **6.5 ms / 266 ms / 4.21 s**. That is 8x, 382x and 4 000x,

    this is flat, which for two implementations of the same construction means the cost is not

    over it.

    Extract one iso-surface from a dense lattice: the module's second **mesh-free** group.

    It takes ``bench_lib`` rather than ``bench_case`` for the reason ``delaunay_triangulation``
    does -- the input is a field, not a mesh, so the work is sized by a plain ``parametrize`` and
    the registry's ``--size`` axis has nothing to act on. Both rows march the identical analytic
    torus SDF, built once per resolution outside the timed region.

    **MeshLib's ``marchingCubes`` is the same algorithm on the same case table**, and the parity
    test in ``tests/test_levelset.py`` pins that hard: at 48^3 the two return the same vertex
    and face *counts* and agree to a two-sided Hausdorff of 1.2e-07, on the vertices and on the
    triangle centroids alike. So this is one of the suite's cleanest comparisons -- two
    implementations of one function, not two algorithms answering one question. The named transform
    the test carries is a convention rather than a cost: ``params.origin`` addresses the voxel
    *centre*, so it is handed ``lower - spacing / 2``, and ``lessInside=True`` is what makes its
    winding match triwarp's outside-positive field convention.

    It is also the fairest CPU-versus-GPU row this module has, for the reason MeshLib was given a
    seat in the first place: it is the suite's only **multi-threaded** CPU reference, so a
    ``triwarp-cuda`` ratio against it is a real one. First measurement, in-harness medians on an
    RTX 5090 -- triwarp-cuda **0.420 / 0.762 ms** over the resolution pair against meshlib's
    **2.60 / 7.36 ms**, i.e. **6.2x** at 64^3 widening to **9.7x** at 128^3. Both are far sublinear
    in the lattice (1.8x and 2.8x for 8x the cells), which is the shape to watch: read a regression
    here as the *slope* steepening rather than the absolute number moving.

    ``triwarp-cpu`` reads **23.9 / 221 ms** on the same pair and so loses to meshlib by 9.1x and
    30x. That is the other edge of the same knife and it is not a defect to chase: 143 threads of
    C++ against Warp's CPU backend is not a comparison of algorithms, and CLAUDE.md section 13's
    "decide on the CUDA number" is what governs.

    **igl and pyvista bring the group to four implementations of one case table**, which makes it
    the best-referenced function in the package -- and each has a lattice convention that has to be
    got right or the row marches a shifted field:

    * ``igl.marching_cubes(S, GV, nx, ny, nz, iso)`` takes the sample *positions* explicitly and
      wants them in **Fortran order**, and it returns **three** values (a 2-tuple unpack raises
      ``ValueError``). The lattice is built once per resolution, outside the timed region.
    * ``pv.ImageData(dimensions=..., origin=..., spacing=...).contour([iso])`` addresses samples on
      grid **nodes**, so its ``origin`` is the bounds' lower corner *directly* -- the opposite of
      MeshLib's voxel-centre convention two paragraphs up. It needs the field flattened in
      **Fortran** order too, and ``contour`` is VTK's own marching cubes.

    All four return the same surface: at 24^3 on a unit-sphere SDF, igl and pyvista both give
    **1 128** vertices and **2 252** faces with a mean radius of **0.999226** to six digits, and the
