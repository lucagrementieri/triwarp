"""
Rasterize each vendored library mark (``svg/`` and ``raster/``) to a fixed-size, square PNG.

Run once (or after touching a source, ``raster/``, or ``SIZE``):

    uv run python benchmarks/assets/logos/render.py

``registry.py`` and ``plot_comparison.py`` only ever read the PNGs this writes -- neither needs
``cairosvg`` at chart-render time, only this script does, and only when regenerating.

Most vendored marks are SVG (a project's own icon-only mark, read from ``svg/``), but not every
project publishes one -- MeshLab's own site links only a PNG, so ``raster/`` holds pre-rasterized
sources for those, loaded directly with Pillow rather than through cairosvg. Both paths converge on
the same `_fit_and_chip`: every source mark is either exactly square already or, for triwarp's own
lockup, wider than it is tall, and rather than distort the wide ones to fit a square, this scales
each to fit inside ``SIZE x SIZE`` at its native aspect ratio and centers it -- so every PNG this
writes is ``SIZE x SIZE`` regardless of the source's own proportions or format, which is the
property a chart placing these as fixed-size axis glyphs actually needs.

A neutral mid-gray chip is composited *behind* every mark, baked into the PNG rather than left to
the chart to add -- one mark (PyTorch3D's icon) is drawn in pure white with no dark element at
all, which is legible on that project's own dark navy site and invisible against
`plot_comparison.py`'s light-mode white chart surface with no chip behind it. A chip sized and
colored consistently for every mark, not special-cased for that one, is what keeps the chart
script's placement logic identical for every library regardless of what background each project
originally designed its mark against.
