"""
Map a benchmark ``library`` id to its rendered logo (if one exists) and its display label.

Keyed by the exact ``id`` strings in ``benchmarks/conftest.py``'s ``LIBRARIES`` table -- that is
the only place library ids are defined, so a new library added there needs one new row here (a
missing id falls back to the id itself as the label, with no logo, rather than raising: a chart
should degrade to a plain text bar for an unmapped library, not fail to render).

Not every library has a distinct mark of its own to show. Three rows deliberately carry
``logo=None``:

- ``pymeshfix`` -- no distinct PyMeshFix project mark exists; its own docs reuse PyVista's logo
  (``reference/pymeshfix/doc/_static/pyvista_logo_sm.png``), which would misattribute the mark.
- ``igl`` (libigl) -- no small icon-only mark is bound in this project's vendored ``reference/``
  copy or found on the project's own site.
- ``potpourri3d`` -- potpourri3d is geometry-central's Python binding and has no separate mark of
  its own; geometry-central likewise has none vendored or found.

``pymeshlab`` is the one row that looks like it should be in that list but isn't: PyMeshLab wraps
MeshLab and ships no mark of its own, but MeshLab's own site (``meshlab.net/img/meshlabLogo.png``)
does -- and using it is the right call, not a stretch, because a PyMeshLab call in this suite is
never anything but a thin binding over the same MeshLab filters the desktop app runs. Labelled
"MeshLab" rather than "PyMeshLab" for that reason -- see ``raster/meshlab.png``'s entry in
``SOURCES.md``, and the caption in any chart that plots it.

A library gaining a mark later is a one-line change here plus a new source under ``svg/`` (or
``raster/``, for a project with no SVG to vendor) and a ``render.py`` re-run -- nothing in
``plot_comparison.py`` needs to change.
