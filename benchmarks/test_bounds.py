"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.bounds``: the axis-aligned box, its diagonal, and the oriented box.

Axis: the **scan sweep**, because that is the only thing the axis-aligned groups can be driven by --
a component-wise min/max over ``V`` has no topology and no parameters, so vertex count is the whole
story. ``oriented_bounding_box`` has a second axis of its own, the candidate count, and it is held
*fixed* at ``_ROTATIONS`` here so the sweep still reads as a sweep; see that group's docstring.

This module exists for one reason beyond coverage: ``aabb`` is on the hot path of *every*
k-NN query (``neighbors.query_*`` calls it to size the hash grid), and it is the clearest example in
the suite of a row that is **host-latency-bound at the small end and bandwidth-bound at the large
end**. Below roughly ``10 ** 3`` vertices it reports the ~340 µs wrapper floor rather than the
reduction (the same floor ``test_creation::test_box`` measures), so a NumPy ``min``/``max`` pair
wins by orders of magnitude there and loses at ``lucy``. The row is here for the crossover; neither
endpoint means anything on its own. That is also why ``bounds.aabb`` does not use the generic
[`reduce.minmax`][triwarp.reduce.minmax] path -- it writes both corners into one six-element buffer
so the host pays a single readback.

References
----------
**trimesh** has no ``bounds`` function, only the cached ``Trimesh.bounds`` property, so the row runs
the uncached formula behind it (``vstack((v.min(0), v.max(0)))``) rather than timing a cache lookup.

**open3d**'s ``get_axis_aligned_bounding_box`` is its own reduction over the same vertices and
returns an object with ``get_min_bound`` / ``get_max_bound``.

**libigl** answers both groups, and in both cases it returns *more* than the number asked for:
``igl.bounding_box(V)`` builds the box as geometry -- 8 corner vertices and the 12 triangles of its
hull -- so its row includes constructing a mesh triwarp never materialises, and
``igl.bounding_box_diagonal(V)`` computes the box internally, exactly as
[`enclosing_diagonal`][triwarp.bounds.enclosing_diagonal] does on triwarp's side. Read both as
upper bounds.

For the **oriented** box, the references answer it a different way and the rows say which:
``igl.oriented_bounding_box`` searches the *same* global candidate set triwarp's first phase does
(Super-Fibonacci over ``SO(3)``, identity appended) but has no refinement phase, so triwarp's row
carries ~3-5 ms of trust-region rounds igl's does not -- rounds that buy the quality the
``tests/test_bounds.py`` bands pin (the sampled-only phase is reachable with
``refine_iterations=0`` and measured 0.45 ms on a 36k cloud back to back against ~2.4 refined).
``trimesh.bounds.oriented_bounds`` and open3d's ``get_minimal_oriented_bounding_box`` are the
*other* algorithm family -- convex hull, then the minimal box flush with each hull face -- so their
rows price a hull triwarp never builds and their cost does not scale with the candidate count at
all. Read them as the cost of that approach rather than as the same work done slower: on ``bunny``
trimesh reads 98.4 ms against igl's 60.6 at 4 096 candidates, even though the hull collapses 35 947
points to 1 564, because the caliper search then runs over all 3 124 hull faces serially.

One measured warning about igl's row, in the spirit of the ``igl.octree`` finding in
``test_neighbors``: ``igl.oriented_bounding_box`` is threaded (``igl::parallel_for`` over the
candidates) and its cost depends on the state of that thread pool. The same call at the same count
measured 203 ms standalone against 60.6 ms in-harness, a 3.4x spread, so quote the in-harness
median and nothing else.

``aabb_union`` gets no row: it is four ``wp.vec3`` component-wise minima at Python scope with no
device work at all, so a row would time the interpreter. It is covered in ``tests/test_bounds.py``.

The module's other half runs the opposite way -- points against a box that already exists -- and
its three groups (``points_in_aabb``, ``crop_points``, ``crop_mesh``) share one shape: triwarp is
**flat** in the input and open3d is **linear**, so each row is a *crossover* and not a ratio. The
flat readings are the host launch floor -- three to five launches plus the one readback that sizes
the output -- so nothing on triwarp's side is bandwidth-bound anywhere in this sweep, and a change
here will show up as a slope long before it shows up as a level.

In-harness medians on an RTX 5090 against open3d's one core, at 2 562 / 40 962 / 163 842 vertices:

| group | triwarp-cuda (µs) | open3d (µs) | triwarp / open3d |
|---|---|---|---|
| ``points_in_aabb`` | 271 / 230 / 301 | 15 / 243 / 991 | 0.06x / 1.06x / **3.29x** |
| ``crop_points`` | 333 / 344 / 314 | 17 / 219 / 830 | 0.05x / 0.64x / **2.65x** |
| ``crop_mesh`` | 1 108 / 1 000 / 1 037 | 186 / 3 014 / 13 718 | 0.17x / 3.02x / **13.2x** |

So the crossover sits near 40 000 vertices for the two point groups and somewhere below 2 562 for
the mesh crop, which is the one row that is worth reading as a win. Every row here is sub-10 ms and
therefore clock-state bimodal (see ``benchmarks/README.md``), so treat the *crossover* as the
finding and not any single ratio; the small-sphere columns are the launch floor being reported and
mean nothing beyond "open3d has no floor".

``crop_points`` is the ``points_in_aabb`` row plus a gather, and the row is kept rather than
declined because open3d answers it through a *different* entry point (``PointCloud.crop`` rather
than ``get_point_indices_within_bounding_box``) whose extra work -- materializing the survivors --
is the same extra work triwarp does, so the two rows bracket it on both sides. The gather's own cost
is the number to check a change against rather than the difference of two medians from separate
rows: measured **interleaved** in one process, a flat 36-42 µs over the whole 64x size range, which
is one ``wp.copy`` launch and matches section 13's launch cost model.

The two ``*_mask`` entry points get **no** rows: each is its group's row minus the
``flatnonzero`` that sizes the index buffer, so a row would re-time the same ``wp.map`` under a
fourth and fifth name. They are covered in ``tests/test_bounds.py``.

**No reference other than open3d answers the query half**, which was checked rather than assumed:
trimesh has no box crop for either a cloud or a mesh, and pyvista's ``clip_box`` is a *clip* -- it
splits the straddling cells and introduces vertices the input never had, so it answers a different
question (its ``crinkle=True`` mode keeps whole cells, which is ``face_mode="any"`` and not the
all-corners rule these groups time).
