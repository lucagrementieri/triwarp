Benchmarks for ``triwarp.halfedge``: edge twins and counter-clockwise vertex one-rings.

Two axes, and they measure different things:

* **scale** -- ``halfedge_twins`` is a hash, a radix sort and a pair-up pass, so its cost is the
  pure ``N`` one and this axis is the whole story for it.
* **valence** -- ``sphere_med`` against ``fan_hub``, with ``V`` and ``F`` pinned and the maximum
  vertex valence going 6 -> 40 960. ``vertex_one_rings`` gives one thread the whole rotation around
  one vertex, so the *widest* ring sets the launch's critical path however small the mesh is. This
  is the group to watch: a 40 960-halfedge serial walk in a single thread is the shape that made
  ``igl.principal_curvature`` take 110 s on this same mesh.

Measured on an RTX 5090: ``halfedge_twins`` runs 314 / 311 / 532 us over the scale axis (the first
two sit on the suite's ~340 us host-side floor, so that axis is reporting launch overhead until
``sphere_large``), while ``vertex_one_rings`` goes **804 us -> 7.97 ms, a 9.9x spread**, on the
valence axis at pinned ``V`` and ``F``. That spread is inherent rather than a defect: the rotation
around a vertex is a linked walk, so a valence-``k`` hub is ``k`` dependent steps that no amount of
parallelism removes. It is recorded here so a future change that makes it *worse* is visible.

``vertex_one_rings_scale`` re-times the same walk with twins precomputed over uniform valence-6
meshes: 252 / 267 / 255 us across a 64x face-count range, i.e. flat and launch-bound. With the
valence group that is the whole cost model here -- ring width matters, mesh size does not.

Both are pure connectivity, so the vertex positions never enter and there is nothing to compare
against another library's *geometry*.

References
----------
None of the four reference libraries exposes an equivalent, so these are before/after
self-comparisons.

**trimesh** has ``Trimesh.face_adjacency`` and ``vertex_neighbors``, but neither is a halfedge
pairing: the first drops which corner of which face an adjacency came from (which is exactly the
information ``twins`` keeps), and ``vertex_neighbors`` is an unordered set per vertex, with no
rotational order -- the property that makes the one-ring useful for tangent spaces. Timing
``vertex_neighbors`` against ``vertex_one_rings`` would compare "group the neighbours" against
"order the neighbours", which is the harder half.

**libigl** has ``igl.triangle_triangle_adjacency``, whose ``(F, 3)`` ``TT``/``TTi`` pair carries the
same information as ``twins`` in a different layout. It is the one reference that could be lined up
here; it is left out because the closest triwarp function is ``adjacency.face_adjacency``, where it
is now a row ([`test_adjacency.py`](test_adjacency.py)), and adding a second row for a reshaped copy
of the same computation would double-count it.

``igl.vertex_triangle_adjacency`` is **not** a ``vertex_one_rings`` reference either, for the reason
given for ``vertex_neighbors`` above: it returns the incident faces per vertex in a ``(VF, NI)`` CSR
with no rotational order, so timing it here would again compare "group the neighbours" against
"order them". It is the reference for the *unordered* CSR instead, in
[`test_adjacency.py`](test_adjacency.py).

**potpourri3d** builds geometry-central's halfedge mesh internally for every solver, and
``pp3d.edges`` is the only place it surfaces the result -- an undirected edge list, not the twin
map. That call is timed in [`test_edges.py`](test_edges.py). **open3d** and **scipy** have nothing
comparable.
