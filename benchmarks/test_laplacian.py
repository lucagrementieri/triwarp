"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.laplacian``.

Times the operator builders that every solver in the library sits on top of: the per-face
half-cotangent weights, the assembled cotangent stiffness matrix, the row-normalized umbrella
operator and the barycentric lumped mass matrix. Two things make this module worth its own file
even though [`test_parametrization.py`](test_parametrization.py) already times solvers that call
these functions: the assembly is a fixed cost paid by *every* solve, and the per-face weight kernels
are pure arithmetic, so a kernel-level change shows up here undiluted by a conjugate-gradient loop.

``cotmatrix_entries`` and ``cotmatrix_entries_intrinsic`` are the same arithmetic reached two ways —
from vertex positions, or from a caller-supplied ``(n_faces, 3)`` edge-length table. The intrinsic
variant is the cleaner measurement of the weight computation itself (no vertex gather, no
``sqrt``-from-positions), which is why both are timed.

References
----------
**libigl** is the reference for everything with a direct equivalent: ``igl.cotmatrix_entries`` (both
overloads), ``igl.cotmatrix`` and ``igl.massmatrix`` (``MASSMATRIX_TYPE_BARYCENTRIC``, the lumping
triwarp implements). **trimesh** is the reference for the umbrella operator —
``trimesh.smoothing.laplacian_calculation`` builds exactly the row-normalized 1-ring averaging
matrix ``laplacian`` returns, for both ``equal_weight`` settings.

``graph_laplacian`` has no reference: libigl builds ``A - diag(rowsum(A))`` inline inside
``igl::harmonic`` rather than exposing it, and reassembling it here out of ``igl.adjacency_matrix``
plus scipy would time a hand-rolled composition rather than a library function. It is timed for
triwarp alone.

The operator family (``k_harmonic``, ``hessian_energy``, ``curved_hessian_energy``,
``crouzeix_raviart_*``) is igl-referenced throughout and sits on the **scale** axis rather than the
scan sweep: ``igl::crouzeix_raviart_*`` and ``igl::orient_halfedges`` (inside
``curved_hessian_energy``) assume edge-manifold input — igl asserts it, triwarp documents it as
undefined -- and the scan meshes are not. Two structural notes on those rows: triwarp assembles
``k_harmonic`` by a triplet pass per power instead of ``bsr_mm``, which is about twice ``bsr_mm``'s
speed through the middle of the axis while ``bsr_mm`` wins at the top of it on CUDA, so this row's
margin is the one that would move first; and ``hessian_energy``'s
per-vertex work is quadratic in valence, which is harmless on the uniform-valence spheres but would
dominate on ``fan_hub``. Every group's margin grows with size, from single digits at the small end
to one or two orders of magnitude at the large one -- except ``crouzeix_raviart_massmatrix``, whose
triwarp side is a flat host launch/alloc floor across the axis and therefore *loses* the small point
while winning the large one outright.

**open3d** has no equivalent for any function in this module. Its smoothing filters
(``filter_smooth_laplacian`` / ``filter_smooth_taubin``, timed in
[`test_smoothing.py`](test_smoothing.py)) build their weights inside the per-iteration C++ loop and
never expose a matrix, and ``open3d.geometry`` has no cotangent or mass matrix at all.

What is inside the timed callable
---------------------------------
Everything the public function does, including the sparse assembly (``bsr_from_triplets`` for
triwarp, the COO→CSC build for igl/trimesh). The trimesh reference constructs its ``tm.Trimesh``
inside the timed region because ``laplacian_calculation`` reads the cached ``vertex_neighbors``
property, which would otherwise make rounds 2..n measure nothing but the sparse assembly.

The edge-length table for the intrinsic variant *is* precomputed and cached (it is the function's
input, not part of its work) — with ``igl.edge_lengths``, so triwarp and libigl consume
bit-identical values.

    Finish the assembly ``ops``' Laplacians defer, so the row prices a matrix and not a promise.

    Every ``ops`` assembler returns an **uncoalesced** ``sparse_coo_tensor`` -- a bag of
    ``(index, value)`` pairs in scatter order -- where triwarp returns a ``BsrMatrix``, a sorted
    CSR with unique columns. ``bsr_from_triplets`` does that sort and dedup eagerly; ``.coalesce()``
    is where torch does the same work. A row that omits it compares an assembly against a scatter,
    which is the same misreading ``_packed_p3d`` describes for the edge lists, arriving by a
    different route: there one side was handed a precomputed input, here one side is let off the
    output.

    The deferral is not a discount invented for this file. ``cot_laplacian`` builds ``6F`` entries
    in which every interior edge appears **twice**, so coalescing takes ``dragon``'s 5 228 484
    entries to 2 618 512 -- the duplicate sum is *deferred*, not avoided, and ``to_dense`` pays it
    on first read. The two edge-list assemblers carry no duplicates (``_nnz()`` is unchanged by the
    call) and pay only the sort, which is still the difference between a scatter and a CSR.

    ``normalize`` adds the row-sum division that separates ``norm_laplacian`` from
    ``laplacian(equal_weight=False)``: the same transform
    [`test_laplacian_operators_match_pytorch3d`](../tests/test_laplacian.py) names to make the two
    matrices equal, in its sparse spelling.

    Attributed across all three groups in one probe, the coalesce is the dominant leveling cost and
    grows with the mesh, while the row-sum normalization adds a further fraction of it. Read that
    probe-to-probe rather than against a harness number (section 15.4).

    ``lucy`` is measured separately because holding three triwarp operators and the torch tensors
    at once does not fit: on the torch side alone the coalesce is several times the raw assembly,
    at an unchanged peak. So the leveling needs no ``skip_larger_than`` cap of its own -- the peak
    is the raw call's, which this module already runs.

    Assembled cotangent stiffness matrix: weight kernel plus the sparse build.

    **pytorch3d**'s ``cot_laplacian`` is the fourth assembly here and the only one on the GPU. It
    does not assemble a matrix: it wraps ``3F`` entries as an *uncoalesced* ``sparse_coo_tensor``
    and adds its transpose, so the duplicate ``(i, j)`` pairs are never summed and no diagonal is
    ever written, where triwarp sorts, dedups and accumulates **12 triplets a face** into a CSR
    *with* its assembled row sum. The row therefore times ``_assembled_p3d``, which finishes the
    assembly -- and this row is why that helper exists.

    The structure names the mechanism rather than merely being consistent with it: on ``dragon``
    the uncoalesced tensor holds 5 228 484 entries (``6F``), coalescing it gives 2 618 512, and
    triwarp's ``nnz_sync()`` differ by **exactly the vertex count**, which is the diagonal

    **flatters pytorch3d by a diagonal**: it is charged the sort and the duplicate sum, not the row
    sum triwarp also assembles.

    Even so the row inverts: triwarp is ahead on most of the scan sweep and within session drift on
    the rest (section 15.7). The prebuilt-sparsity-pattern rewrite the old number invited (assemble
    into an ``edges_unique`` pattern instead of sorting triplets) is **declined on that

    alongside, which is what

    (``1 / inv_areas == 3 * M_ii``). So this row times the **same call** the
    ``cotmatrix`` group times and is an *upper* bound here rather than a race -- it prices the
    stiffness assembly as well. It is still worth the row: it is the only GPU one in the group, and
    the two rows together say what the shared call costs and what fraction of it either half is.

    **This row deliberately does not go through ``_assembled_p3d``**, unlike the three assembly
    groups: ``inv_areas`` is the dense second return and a coalesce of the *stiffness* tensor
    beside it would charge pytorch3d for an answer this row does not read. The scope mismatch here
    already runs against pytorch3d and needs no correction -- and it does not need one on the
    numbers either, which is worth recording because it is easy to file this row with the other
    three: triwarp is already ahead on both meshes.

    The piecewise-linear gradient per face: three cross products, no connectivity, no solve.

    The pair of ids is the same amortization question the ``*_precomputed`` rows elsewhere ask:
    ``from_positions`` recomputes the per-face normals and areas, ``face_data`` is handed them. The
    gap is what a caller who already holds that pair saves -- and the heat solvers, which are the
    in-repo consumers, always do.

    **The two sides return different things and that is the comparison.** ``igl.grad(V, F)``
    *assembles* a sparse ``(3F, V)`` operator and never applies it; triwarp applies the same
    operator face by face and never materialises it. So igl's row is dominated by building 3F x 3
    triplets and triwarp's by reading the field, which is exactly the trade the two designs make --
    read it as "assemble once, apply many" against "apply directly", not as one side being faster at
    the same job. The values agree, through the matrix product, in ``tests/test_laplacian.py``.

    **pyvista applies it and then averages onto the points**: ``compute_derivative`` returns a
    per-*point* gradient for a point-data field (``preference='cell'`` does not move it), so its row
    carries a cell-to-point pass triwarp's does not. It is the closest thing here to triwarp's
    "apply directly" design, which is why it earns a row that igl's assembled operator cannot be
    compared against directly.
