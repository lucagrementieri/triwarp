"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.neighbors``: the k-nearest-neighbour queries.

This is the direct gate for the k-NN search radius. Twelve call sites in ``triwarp.metrics``, the
point-cloud ICP path in ``triwarp.registration`` and three sites in ``triwarp.reconstruction`` all
bottom out here, and until this module existed none of them had a measurement isolating the query
kernel from the surrounding algorithm.

Setup
-----
``points`` is the mesh's own vertices; ``queries`` is a fixed 20 000-point subsample pushed off the
surface by 1 % of the bbox diagonal along a fixed direction, so no query coincides with a data
point (which would make ``k=1`` trivially certifiable at radius 0) while the spacing stays
realistic.

Axes
----
Nothing here is driven by a mesh property — the meshes are used only as point clouds — so the axes
are the structure's own parameters:

* **k**, as separate groups (``_k1`` / ``_k7``) rather than a sweep, because the two are different
  call sites and different *code*: the candidate row is register-resident with one kernel per
  row-size bucket (``kernels.neighbors.KNN_ROW_BUCKETS``). ``k=1`` is what ``distance.py`` and ICP
  use, ``k=7`` is ``ball_pivoting``'s seed table. The larger in-repo values (30, 64) are timed by
  [`test_points.py`](test_points.py), where the outlier statistics ask for them.
* **build against query**. The k-NN groups include the build, which is what a caller passing raw
  buffers pays; the ``*_from_points`` groups time the build alone, so subtracting them answers
  whether ICP's per-iteration index rebuild is the cost or a red herring.
* **structure resolution** — ``leaf_size``, ``grid_bins``, and ``radius`` for the ball queries. A
  leaf too large builds cheaply and traverses slowly; too few bins degenerates into a linear scan
  and too many pays for empty cells. Ball cost is the expected neighbour count, roughly
  ``density * radius ** 3``, and the two-phase count-then-fill pays it twice.

The ball groups use the ``*_with_offsets`` form: plain ``query_*_ball`` returns a Python ``list`` of
per-query arrays, adding ``O(n_queries)`` of host slicing that would swamp the kernel. That cost is
real but belongs to a different question.

For the k-NN groups the timed callable is everything the public function does, index build and
bounds reduction included — hiding the build would misreport the API. The build and ball groups
pass a prebuilt structure where the signature allows one, so they isolate what they name.

Reference
---------
**Every reference here is index-agnostic, so the BVH and hash-grid groups carry the same rows.**
None of the four exposes a structure choice, and the cloud, the queries and ``k`` are identical
between the two group families, so a ``query_*_bvh`` / ``query_*_hashgrid`` pair reads as **one**
comparison with triwarp's own index as the axis. The backend is a keyword, not a second entry
point, so the suffix is that keyword's value and the two rows are the same function timed twice;
``tests/test_neighbors.py`` parametrizes every comparison over ``backend`` and
``test_the_two_backends_agree`` pins that the pair returns identical answers, which is what makes
it a cost comparison rather than two measurements of two things.

**scipy** ``spatial.KDTree`` — the same reference the tests validate against, and the only exact
k-NN in the group with a matching signature. Its construction is inside the timed region for the
same reason triwarp's index build is.

**libigl** ``igl.knn`` is the second exact k-NN, byte-identical to ``KDTree``'s indices on a
tie-free cloud. Three things shape its rows:

* **Seven positional arguments, and the octree is built over the *data* cloud**:
  ``igl.knn(queries, points, k, *igl.octree(points)[:4])``. The build is timed inside, and also
  alone in ``bvh_from_points``.
* **``igl.octree``'s cost is mostly Python objects, and its variance is entirely the garbage
  collector** — it returns per-cell point lists as nested Python lists, several per input point, so
  enabling ``gc`` turns a tight distribution into a several-fold spread. **Read the igl rows'
  medians, not their minima**, and read the build-included numbers as pricing the binding as much
  as the search. Same hazard as the ``*_lists`` variants elsewhere, except here it lands on the only
  structure igl exposes for k-NN, so there is no array form to switch to.
* **Capped at ``bunny``**, one step below scipy's ``dragon``, because that churn grows with the cell
  count. ``k > n_points`` silently returns ``n_points`` columns rather than raising.

**open3d** ``o3d.core.nns.NearestNeighborSearch`` is the third exact k-NN and is **batched** — the
legacy ``KDTreeFlann``'s only query is a Python loop over ``search_knn_vector_3d``, several times
dearer because the loop times the interpreter. Its distances come back **squared** (as FLANN's do)
and ``fixed_radius_search`` returns a CSR-like ``(indices, distances, offsets)`` triple. The index
build sits inside the timed callable for the k-NN groups and outside for the ball group, matching
scipy; note ``fixed_radius_index(radius)`` bakes the radius in, so each radius pays its own build.
**trimesh** has no k-NN entry point.

``nearest_neighbor_distance`` is the one group whose queries are the cloud *itself* rather than the
subsample, because that is how its callers use it — once over the whole input, before
``reconstruction`` can pick a ball radius or an octree depth. open3d's counterpart searches point by
point in C++, serial but not a Python loop; triwarp goes from level with it to more than an order of
magnitude ahead across the ``scale`` axis, the ratio growing because triwarp's cost is nearly flat.

    strided column copy, so the ratio against ``query_nearest_bvh_k1`` prices that tail.

    open3d's ``compute_nearest_neighbor_distance`` builds a ``KDTreeFlann`` and then searches one
    point at a time in C++ -- so it is serial, but not the Python-per-query loop the legacy tree
    would be from this side, and it is the same quantity to 9e-09.

    meshlib's ``findNClosestPointsPerPoint(cloud, 1)`` is the batched, multi-threaded form of the
    same self-query and returns the neighbour *index*; the distance is one subtraction away and is
    not timed on either side. **Its point tree is cached on the cloud and the row drops it per
    round**, which is worth several-fold and is what makes the three rows comparable: triwarp builds
    a BVH and open3d a ``KDTreeFlann`` inside their own calls, where meshlib would otherwise reuse a
    cached one. ``invalidateCaches`` is the lever rather than a fresh ``PointCloud`` per round,
    because rebuilding the cloud itself adds the whole point allocation and with it a spread that
    swamps what is being measured.
    At the large end triwarp leads the multi-threaded reference by several times and the serial one
    by an order of magnitude. At the small end all three land within noise of each other -- the
    cloud is too small to fill the GPU or to pay for a thread pool, which is where a ratio here
    stops meaning anything.
