"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.interpolation``: averaging scatters, barycentric pull, cloud interpolation.

Three axes, because the module holds three different kinds of function:

* **valence** for the three ``average_*`` scatters. Each is ``3F`` atomic adds into ``V`` slots (or
  ``3F`` gathers into ``F`` for the face direction), so in principle a mesh with a few very
  high-valence hubs serialises where a regular one does not. ``fan_hub`` is the extreme: identical
  vertex *and* face count to ``sphere_med``, but its cone apex and base centre have valence 40 960
  against a uniform 6. The finding these rows exist to keep visible is that it does **not** cost
  much -- see ``test_vertices.py``, whose normals scatters read under 2x across the same axis.
* **scale** for ``transfer_onto_vertices``, which is not a scatter at all: it is a closest-point
  query per target vertex plus a barycentric blend, so its cost is the BVH's and nothing this module
  owns.
* **neighbourhood size** for ``interpolate_from_points``, whose kernel is one pass over the CSR a
  ball query returns -- so the row is really the query's output size, and the radius is derived from
  the mean edge length to hold the neighbour count fixed across meshes. Measured 0.73 / 2.35 ms on
  ``bunny`` at 8 / 64 neighbours, against pyvista's 27 / 97 ms; and 18 ms on ``dragon`` at 64. The
  64-neighbour case is capped at ``happy_buddha`` because the CSR is ``n_queries * neighborhood``
  pairs and lucy would ask for 5.0 GB.

``average_onto_vertices`` and ``transfer_onto_vertices`` were previously timed in
[`test_vertices.py`](test_vertices.py). They moved here with their group names unchanged, because
the ``benchmark(group=)`` name is a cross-suite key every ``parity`` marker cites -- renaming one
would break the gate rather than relocate a row.

References
----------
**libigl** covers all three averaging directions and is the reference this module was written
against (``tests/test_interpolation.py`` has used it as the oracle from the start; these rows add
the missing timings):

* ``igl.average_onto_faces(F, S)`` is the vertex-to-face mean;
* ``igl.average_onto_vertices(V, F, S)`` is the face-to-vertex mean -- note its ``S`` is a
  per-face **scalar**, not a per-face vector, which is the one signature trap here;
* ``igl.average_from_edges_onto_vertices(F, E, oE, uE)`` needs the ``(E, oE)`` halfedge numbering
  from ``igl.orient_halfedges(F)``, which is also what triwarp's edge-based overload consumes, so
  both sides receive the identical edge indexing rather than each building its own.

**pymeshlab**'s ``compute_scalar_transfer_face_to_vertex(areaweight=False)`` is the plain corner
mean of ``average_onto_vertices``, and ``transfer_attributes_per_vertex(qualitytransfer=True)`` is
the barycentric pull. Both read and write mesh *attributes* rather than taking arrays, so each row
seeds the input attribute and reads the output one; the transfer needs **two** meshes in the set and
writes into the second, so that row builds a fresh two-mesh MeshSet inside the timed callable --
twice the ~0.47 µs/vertex build cost, which at ``bunny`` is 34 ms before any transfer happens.

**pyvista**'s ``DataSet.interpolate`` is ``interpolate_from_points``'s reference: a
``vtkPointInterpolator`` with a ``vtkGaussianKernel``, given the identical radius and sharpness, so
the two compute the same weighted mean and differ only in the locator (a ``vtkStaticPointLocator``
against triwarp's BVH). It is the module's only pyvista row -- VTK has no per-element averaging
filter, so the three ``average_*`` groups keep libigl.

trimesh and open3d have no equivalent for any of the four mesh-side functions: attribute averaging
over a mesh's incidence structure is not something either exposes as a function.
