"""
Time both triwarp targets, as two processes, so the CPU rows are not inflated.

``uv run python benchmarks/devices.py`` runs a CUDA pass and then a ``triwarp-cpu`` pass, and the
CPU pass is spawned with ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""``. The variable is the whole point: **Warp's CPU
work costs more once CUDA has been initialised in the process**, and the charge behaves like a
per-launch one, so the factor scales with launch count rather than with work:

- a few big kernels -- ``edges_unique`` barely notices, a few tens of percent;
- an iterative solver pays more than an order of magnitude, and so does a whole test module built
  on one.

Unchanged by ``warp.config.launch_array_access_mode``, so it is CUDA presence and not CLAUDE.md
section 3.9's launch guard. Either way a
``triwarp-cpu`` row taken in a CUDA-initialised process is not a slow number, it is a **wrong** one,
and it reads as triwarp losing to CPU references it actually beats. ``benchmarks/conftest.py`` warns
when that configuration is selected; this script is the way to avoid it.

``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` has to be set before the process starts, so this can only be a second
process -- not a fixture and not a context manager. Same reason ``tests/devices.py`` exists.

Why the CPU pass is narrowed to ``-k triwarp-cpu``
-------------------------------------------------
The CPU *reference* libraries (trimesh / igl / open3d / scipy / potpourri3d / pymeshlab / pyvista /
meshlib) are included in **every** pass by ``_selected_libraries``, so a naive two-pass split would
time them twice and write duplicate rows. Benchmark ids carry the library
(``test_faces_to_edges[bunny-triwarp-cpu]``), so ``-k triwarp-cpu`` keeps the second pass to exactly
the rows that need the CUDA-free process. The references stay in the CUDA pass, where they are
unaffected -- they never touch Warp.

Usage
-----
``uv run python benchmarks/devices.py``
    CUDA pass (``triwarp-cuda`` + every reference), then a CUDA-hidden ``triwarp-cpu`` pass.
``uv run python benchmarks/devices.py -- --size=small -k edges``
    Everything after ``--`` is forwarded to both pytest invocations.

Pass ``--benchmark-json=<path>`` and the two passes write ``<path>.cuda.json`` and
``<path>.cpu.json``: one file per process, because pytest-benchmark writes its JSON at session end
and the second pass would otherwise overwrite the first.
