"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.edges`` vs trimesh and libigl (igl), on real scan meshes.

Mirrors the correctness tests in ``tests/test_edges.py`` but times each function instead of
asserting equality. Every test is parametrised over ``(mesh_name, library)`` by the harness in
``conftest.py`` and receives a ``bench_case`` bundling the inputs and a GPU-safe ``run``; the
``benchlibs`` marker declares which reference libraries implement an equivalent of the function.

The triwarp ``edges_unique*`` calls pass ``n_vertices=`` (known from the mesh) so the API's
internal ``.numpy().max()`` host sync does not dominate the GPU measurement.

**open3d** has no equivalent for anything in this module. Its ``TriangleMesh`` exposes edges only as
diagnostics over specific predicates (``get_non_manifold_edges``,
``get_self_intersecting_triangles``) and never as a general edge list, so there is no
``faces_to_edges`` / ``edges_unique`` / ``edge_lengths`` to time against.

**potpourri3d** does have one: ``pp3d.edges`` returns geometry-central's internal undirected edge
list. It cannot run on the scan meshes -- geometry-central rejects a mesh with an unreferenced
vertex, and every scan mesh has some -- so it is timed in the separate ``edges_unique_manifold``
group on the synthetic ``scale`` axis instead. Its ordering is geometry-central's own, so the row
includes building the halfedge mesh those indices refer to. That ordering does *not* make it
unusable as an oracle -- sorting dissolves it, and
``tests/test_edges.py::test_edges_unique_matches_potpourri3d`` asserts the two edge sets are equal.
It has no counterpart for the directed, per-corner or length variants.

**pymeshlab** appears in ``mean_unique_edge_length`` alone. ``get_geometric_measures`` returns
``avg_edge_length`` in a dict alongside the area, volume, barycentre and inertia tensor, so it is an
*upper* bound on the mean edge length taken by itself; the same call is the ``centroid`` reference
in [`test_triangles.py`](test_triangles.py), so those two rows are literally the same measurement
read twice. It has no general edge list either: ``Mesh.edge_matrix()`` exists but is populated only
by filters that build the edge topology, not on demand, so there is nothing to time for
``faces_to_edges`` / ``edges_unique`` / the length variants.
