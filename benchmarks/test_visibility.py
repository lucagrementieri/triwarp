"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.visibility``: how far the surface is from a point.

Five functions, three shapes of work, and the split is what the rows are for.

- **Ray bundles.** ``ambient_occlusion`` traces a hemisphere lattice outward per point and
  ``shape_diameter`` fires the same lattice inward and then trims the distances. Both are
  embarrassingly parallel and both are among the slowest per-vertex filters MeshLab ships, so they
  are the module's clearest GPU-versus-one-core rows. ``rays`` is the axis rather than the mesh:
  cost is exactly linear in it on both sides, and the sweep pins that. Read the two groups against
  each other at equal ray counts -- the gap is what ``shape_diameter``'s two extra passes over its
  ``(n_vertices, n_rays)`` distance scratch cost, and it should be small, because the rays dominate.
- **Iterated closest-point.** ``max_tangent_sphere`` shrinks a sphere until nothing but the surface
  touches it, so it pays a full BVH closest-point pass *per iteration* (up to 100) plus an 8-byte
  convergence readback each time -- deliberately, since an extra iteration costs far more than the
  readback. The ``_reach`` row runs it outward, which is the branch where the first ray escapes and
  the packed support-argmax passes over the vertex cloud run instead.
- **One ray, or one sphere.** ``thickness`` is a dispatcher, and its two methods are two orders of
  magnitude apart by construction. It sits on the **depth** axis because both pay for surface
  crossings: a ray through ``shells_8`` meets 16 of them against ``sphere_med``'s 2, and the sphere
  method's convergence depends on local thickness, which nested shells make small.

- **Every vertex, one ray or one sphere.** ``thickness_at_vertices`` is the same dispatcher as
  ``thickness`` run over the mesh's *own* vertices rather than a 10 000-point subsample, and it
  exists for one reason: it is the only shape MeshLib can be timed in. Its
  ``computeRayThicknessAtVertices`` takes no query set -- it answers at every vertex, in parallel
  over all cores -- so a row against the subsampled group would price a different number of
  queries, the reason section 6 bars ``findNClosestPointsPerPoint`` from
  ``query_nearest_bvh_k7``. Read it against ``thickness_interior`` for the per-query cost and
  against MeshLib for the one fair CPU-versus-GPU comparison this module has.

``volumetric_obscurance`` has **no group**. It shares ``ambient_occlusion``'s kernel and differs
only in a per-hit ``exp(-tau * t)`` factor, so a group over it would re-measure the same axis;
MeshLab's
``compute_scalar_by_volumetric_obscurance`` would nonetheless be a real second reference, and that
is a benchmark gap rather than an API one. Recorded in ``benchmarks/README.md``.

Two caveats for reading the pymeshlab rows. ``compute_scalar_by_shape_diameter_function_per_vertex``
is the most expensive per-vertex filter MeshLab ships and its ``cone_amplitude`` parameter is a
**no-op** in the 2025.07 build -- byte-identical output at 90 and
120 degrees -- so its cone is whatever it is. Both filters write only the vertex scalar attribute,
so the MeshSet is shared rather than rebuilt per call. Open3D has no equivalent for anything here.

**trimesh is the oracle for two of these five functions and is now timed for both.**
``trimesh.proximity.thickness`` and ``max_tangent_sphere`` have been the correctness references in
``tests/test_visibility.py`` since those functions landed, which this docstring did not say -- it
recorded only that Open3D has nothing, leaving ``thickness_interior`` reading as unreferenced and
``max_tangent_sphere_reach``'s exemption reading as "no library has an exterior form". Both take a
**query set** and their own normals, so unlike MeshLib they fit the subsampled groups directly.
They are single-threaded Python over embree and the ``max_sphere`` branch iterates in Python, so
their rows run at ``_N_QUERIES_TM`` queries rather than 10 000 and must be read per query.
