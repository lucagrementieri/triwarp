"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.repair``.

Axis: **defect count** for three of the four groups, **diameter** for the fourth. Repair functions
are the clearest case in the package of cost a face count cannot predict — they all "find the broken
things and fix them", so the number of broken things is the driver and the mesh they sit in is
nearly irrelevant. Every defect group runs on ``sphere_med`` and sweeps the *injected defect count*:

* ``resolve_duplicated_faces`` — 0 % against 10 % cancelling flipped pairs.
* ``remove_non_manifold_faces`` — 0 against 1 024 extra faces, each making its three edges
  3-incident. This one loops: removing faces can create *new* non-manifold edges, so a pathological
  input uses all ``max_iter`` rounds where a clean one exits after the first test.
* ``remove_duplicated_vertices`` — on an *unwelded* soup (every face owning its own three vertices,
  the state a freshly loaded STL is in), sweeping ``epsilon``. The two values are two code paths
  rather than two thresholds: positive ``epsilon`` snaps to ``round(v / epsilon)``, while ``0``
  buckets by the high bits of the float32 representation — a *relative* cell about 2.4e-4 wide, not
  an equality test.

``make_winding_consistent`` gets the **diameter** axis instead: its cost is a property of the
face-adjacency graph, not the defect count. A formulation that *propagates* the orientation bits one
level per round is two orders of magnitude slower on the high-diameter mesh than on the compact one
at identical vertex count, where trimesh's equivalent goes the other way; the shipped union-find
form is flat across the axis and faster than trimesh at both ends. Same finding and same fix as
``face_orientation_bits`` in [`test_validation.py`](test_validation.py), the machinery underneath.
pymeshlab settles what that axis was really measuring: its serial face-to-face visit is *faster* on
the high-diameter mesh too. So graph diameter is not intrinsically expensive for this problem; it
was expensive only for the level-propagating formulation.

The two *geometric* defect groups sit on **quality** instead of a defect sweep, because their
defects are not injectable: ``flip_t_vertices`` looks for thin and folded triangles and
``saddle_graded`` already has them by construction, where ``saddle`` gives it nothing to do.

References
----------
**open3d**'s ``remove_duplicated_triangles`` solves the same "deduplicate a face array" problem with
a hash set over index triples against triwarp's sort-based grouping. It compares dedup *machinery*,
not results — the semantics differ twice over: open3d keeps one representative of each duplicate
group where triwarp applies a signed-count rule that drops cancelling ``(+1, -1)`` pairs outright,
and open3d's hash is **orientation-sensitive**, so on this deliberately-flipped input it removes
nothing and returns the face count unchanged. The hash pass over all ``n`` triples still runs, which
is the cost being compared; the assertion below only checks the count did not grow. Open3D mutates
in place and the operation is idempotent, so its mesh is rebuilt inside the timed callable.
**trimesh**'s ``repair.fix_winding`` is the orientation reference; it has no non-manifold face
removal.

**pymeshlab** is the only library covering *all four* groups, and the first reference of any kind
for ``remove_non_manifold_faces`` — neither trimesh nor open3d nor libigl removes non-manifold faces
at all:

* ``meshing_repair_non_manifold_edges(method='Remove Faces')`` is the same idea, greedier: for each
  non-manifold edge MeshLab iteratively deletes the *smallest-area* incident face until the edge is
  2-manifold, where triwarp drops every face on an over-incident edge and re-tests.
* ``meshing_remove_duplicate_faces`` is orientation-*insensitive*, so unlike open3d's hash it does
  see the flipped copies — but it keeps one representative rather than cancelling pairs.
* ``meshing_remove_duplicate_vertices`` and ``meshing_merge_close_vertices(threshold=...)`` are
  exactly triwarp's two code paths, so this is the one group where the ``epsilon`` sweep maps across
  libraries one-for-one.
* ``meshing_re_orient_faces_coherently`` is a serial face-to-face visit against triwarp's parity
  union-find, precisely the contrast the ``diameter`` axis exposes.

Every one rewrites the topology, so the MeshSet is built inside the timed callable from the
*defect-injected* arrays rather than the registry mesh, and each row carries that build — a large
share at this size, most of a clean ``remove_duplicate_faces`` row and a third of the unwelded
soup's dedup. Subtract it before quoting a ratio.

    The whole pipeline: broken scan in, single watertight solid out.

    The one group in this file whose input is a real scan rather than an injected defect, because
    the whole point of the composite is that the *distribution* of defects drives it -- 86 boundary
    loops and 1 084 self-intersecting faces on ``bunny_decimated``, 5 loops and none on ``bunny``,
    so the two meshes exercise different stages of the same call and the pair is the measurement.
    Capped at ``bunny``: ``dragon`` is seconds of pymeshfix load plus seconds of query per round,
    and the composite runs the self-intersection loop over all of it.

    ``clean_from_arrays`` is pymeshfix's headline and this is the one group where its row is timed
    rather than declared, because the operation clears the load by a wide margin -- around 70 % of
    the round on both meshes. The load still cannot leave the timed callable -- a ``PyTMesh`` takes
    exactly one ``load_array`` -- so read the row as pipeline-plus-load and subtract accordingly.

    triwarp wins the group by an order of magnitude and the gap widens with the mesh, because the
    composite's per-stage cost is a fixed chain of wrapper calls plus device passes where the
    reference is sequential C++ throughout. Read it knowing what
    dominates triwarp's side, which is **not** kernel time: a dozen wrapper chains inside a
    convergence loop, each a handful of launches. Anything spent optimizing this belongs in the
    refill chain and the self-intersection loop, exactly as the ``fix_self_intersections`` group's
    own note says; a faster kernel would not move it.

    Both rows assert a watertight one-component answer rather than a count, since the two libraries
    sacrifice different amounts of surface around a defect. On these two meshes they agree
    closely -- ``bunny_decimated`` comes back at **8 188 v / 16 372 f from both**, watertight with
    chi = 2 -- and ``tests/test_repair.py`` measures where they agree exactly (3.11e-08 on
    interpenetrating shells) and where they do not (a self-intersecting torus, 0.400).

    The axis is the component count -- 1, 64 then 1 024 at a fixed 81 920 faces -- which is this
    function's only cost driver: the labelling is a connected-components pass over the face
    adjacency and the extraction is one compaction, and neither cares how the faces are distributed
    between components. The mesh size is pinned across the three points so the row reads as the
    component count alone.

    **The threshold keeps everything**, deliberately: ``min_faces=2`` passes every component of
    every one of these meshes. A threshold that dropped components would make the extraction
    cheaper on exactly the meshes that have more of them, so the axis would be measuring the
    selection rather than the labelling, and the three points would stop being comparable. All the

    ``cluster_connected_triangles`` returns the per-triangle cluster id plus each cluster's triangle
    count and area, and the mask and the removal are the caller's, which is what the row times; it
    also mutates, so its mesh is rebuilt per round too.

    pymeshfix is **not** a row here: ``remove_smallest_components`` is a tenth or so of a round
    behind a load that cannot be hoisted out of it, so the number would be the load. Its rule is

    the whole cost is the mask-and-scan that proves there is nothing to remove. Both are on the scan
    sweep because the operation has no other axis: it is one pass over ``V`` plus one over ``3F``.

    ``igl.remove_unreferenced`` returns the same four things in the same order (vertices, faces,
    forward map, inverse map) and is already the oracle in ``tests/test_repair.py``. Note it takes
    ``int32`` faces here while most of the package wants ``int64`` -- passing ``faces_np`` directly
    works because nanobind casts, but the cast is a copy of the face buffer on every call and it is
    inside the timing.

    agreeing.

    pyvista is not identical either, on an input class the scan meshes do not contain: on a

    """
    Repair a genuine self-intersection, by cutting-and-refilling or by rebuilding.

    The two methods are different costs of different kinds and the parametrize keeps them
    attributable. ``local`` is a detect-dilate-delete-refill loop whose cost is the *damage*: the
    detector runs on the whole mesh but the DP runs on the rims, so it tracks the intersecting band
    rather than the face count. ``voxel`` is a signed distance field plus a marching pass, so its
    cost is the *lattice* and it does not care what was wrong -- visible in its output, which is the
    same face count from a 20x-larger input.

    Why the ``tangle`` axis and not two welded spheres
    --------------------------------------------------
    This group ran for four rounds on ``sphere_med`` concatenated with a shifted copy of itself, and
    **the meshlib ``local`` cell was timing a no-op**: that construction is two components, and
    ``mm.localFixSelfIntersections`` returns a multi-component mesh unchanged -- byte-identical
    buffers, every colliding face intact, at every configuration probed (CLAUDE.md section 7.6
    carries the sweep). The row read as this suite's largest single loss against a call that
    returned its argument.

    ``tangle_torus`` is a self-intersecting **single** component, so both libraries do real work and
    the comparison is like-for-like for the first time. It is also a *size* axis rather than one
    point, because this is a crossover and a single row would report whichever side of it the mesh
    landed on: the serial C++ fixer leads by several-fold at the small end and is level at the large
    one, while the voxel path wins throughout.

    **Read the ``local`` parity at the large end with its quality caveat, which runs the other
    way.** On this axis' own inputs, with triwarp's detector applied to both outputs: at the small
    end both clear every intersection, but at the large one triwarp leaves a residue where MeshLib
    reaches zero. So the large cell is a tie for a slightly *less* complete repair -- and the two
    are still different algorithms (MeshLib subdivides the affected band and relaxes it, growing the
    face count; this cuts the band out and refills the rim, shrinking it). ``max_iter`` is what
    closes triwarp's residue, and the function's Notes carry that table.

    The post-condition is what
    ``tests/test_repair.py::test_fix_self_intersections_local_clears_them`` claims, and it uses
    MeshLib as a **detector** rather than as a fixer -- the sound way to consult it here, since on
    that test's own fixture the MeshLib *fixer* doubles the intersecting face count.

    Against the two upstream groups the **cut and fill dominate**, and increasingly: about half the

    One pass over every vertex, plus a face compaction -- and usually nothing to remove.

    The scan meshes carry few valence-3 interior vertices, so this group mostly times the *search*:
    a ``vertex_one_rings`` build, a candidate map, an independence pass and one readback. That is
    the honest thing to measure, because the search is what a caller pays unconditionally in a
    repair pipeline while the removal is proportional to a defect that may not be there.

    meshlib's row is ``findInnerVertsOfDegree(topology, 3)`` -- the candidate mask, not the removal,
    since ``eliminateDegree3Vertices`` mutates in place and would need a fresh mesh per round while
    finding nothing after the first. So it is the same *search* on both sides; where it is not a
    like-for-like is that meshlib is handed a ``MeshTopology`` built outside its row and triwarp
    builds a halfedge structure inside its own.

    Attributed on a clean mesh, where nothing is removed, two thirds of one pass is
    ``vertex_one_rings`` and most of the rest is the vertex-count readback. So the floor is the
    halfedge build, and a scan mesh's several milliseconds are that floor times the number of
    passes -- removing one valence-3 vertex can expose another, so the loop runs until it finds
    none. meshlib's row times only the *mask* and is correspondingly far cheaper.

    **The asymmetry with meshlib's prebuilt ``MeshTopology`` is not a hoist waiting to happen**,
    which is worth saying because it reads like one. ``vertex_one_rings`` takes an optional
    ``twins=``, so the build *could* be lifted out of the loop -- except that each pass deletes
    faces, so the next pass's halfedge structure is over a different mesh and has to be rebuilt.
    The only genuinely wasted build is the last pass's, which finds nothing, and knowing that in
    advance is the question the pass exists to answer.

    Moving the vertex compaction out of the loop was tried and is **flat** at the pass counts a scan
    mesh reaches; it is kept because it is strictly less work, not because it showed up.

    Closing rim notches: per pass, a halfedge build, a rim walk and one candidate test per vertex.

    The cost is dominated by the halfedge build and the per-*vertex* candidate launch, so it tracks
    the mesh rather than the rim -- which is the honest thing to say about it, since a rim is
    ``O(sqrt(n_vertices))`` and the work is not. A rim-indexed candidate pass would fix that and is
    the obvious follow-up; it is not done because the pass count is one by default.

    meshlib's ``straightenBoundary`` is per **rim** and in place, so its row loops over
    ``findHoleRepresentiveEdges`` on a fresh mesh per round, and its topology build is inside the
    timed callable the way ours is. Both take the same two gates by the same definitions and agree
    exactly on a ragged planar rim (``tests/test_repair.py``).

    triwarp wins the group by more than an order of magnitude and by more the larger the mesh. Both
    rows carry their own structure build, so the ratio is the parallel candidate test against a
    serial rim walk, and it widens with the mesh exactly as that predicts.

    The rim walk is keyed on **halfedges** rather than on vertices, because edge-manifoldness does
    not make the rim a set of simple loops and the per-vertex tables raced at a bowtie vertex
    (``kernels/repair.py::collect_rim_links``). It is a correctness fix and it also came out
    slightly *cheaper*: two per-halfedge tables replaced three per-vertex ones plus a face table,
    and the candidate and emit kernels lost three arguments between them; the fan walk that finds

    The geometric answer to the same defect ``remove_degree3_vertices`` removes topologically.

    compaction and no loop here, so the gap between the two rows is the whole cost of removing
    rather than moving, and this row should sit at roughly the halfedge build alone -- which is
    about two thirds of the other group's single pass.

    meshlib's ``hardSmoothTetrahedrons`` is the same move on the same set, vertex for vertex --
    it sweeps sequentially, reading neighbours it has already moved, and one maximal independent
    set per pass with lowest index winning reproduces that order exactly (``tests/test_repair.py``,
    Class A on a tetrahedron where all four vertices are candidates). It mutates in place, so its
    mesh is rebuilt per round; the other group's meshlib row times only the *mask*, which is why
    this one is the like-for-like pair.

    The independent-set pass and its loop are not free: they cost roughly a third of the call, most
    of it the one host readback that terminates the loop (routing that through ``reduce.sum``
    instead of a bool readback is dearer still). It is a correctness fix rather than a tuning
    choice -- see ``kernels/repair.py``'s ``flatten_degree3_positions`` for what moving two
    neighbours at once does to a tetrahedron -- so the cost is recorded rather than weighed.

    triwarp wins the group by more than an order of magnitude at every size. Against
    ``remove_degree3_vertices`` on the same meshes this is several times cheaper -- the ratio the
