"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.measures``: the whole-mesh reductions, which are readback-bound.

Every group here ends in a host-side value, so each pays at least one device-to-host crossing on top
of its device pass -- and at the sizes in the scan sweep that latency is a large share of the total.
That is the axis these rows measure: not the arithmetic, which is trivially parallel per face, but
how many crossings the *shape of the return type* forces. Read ``surface_centroid`` (two crossings)
against ``moments`` (four, for ten sums) -- the gap is nearly all latency.

What this axis is **not** is a licence to copy arrays. Reducing the ``vec3d`` integrand buffers
with ``.numpy().sum(axis=0)`` is not a crossing per return value but 72 bytes *per face* moved to be
added on the host; ``wp.utils.array_sum`` (which reduces a ``vec3d`` array componentwise, so no
kernel is needed) keeps the crossings at four and the bytes crossed at 80, and is what turns this
row from a loss into a win against igl. It still loses the smallest scan mesh, where four launches
plus four 4-byte reads are the floor and igl's faces fit in cache. Read the **min** in this group,
not the median: with the igl and trimesh rows sharing the process the triwarp medians here run an
order of magnitude above its own min, the same instability
[`test_holes.py`](test_holes.py) documents for its DP rows.

``get_geometric_measures`` is pymeshlab's reference for the centroid and it does *more*: one
read-only call returns ``shell_barycenter`` (the area-weighted centroid triwarp computes),
``barycenter`` (the plain vertex mean), the surface area, the mesh volume, the average edge length
and the inertia tensor. So that row is an **upper** bound on the centroid alone -- and the same
number appears as the ``mean_edge_length`` reference in [`test_edges.py`](test_edges.py), which is
worth knowing before reading either as a per-quantity cost. It is read-only, so it shares the
MeshSet.

``volume`` and ``euler_characteristic`` have **no groups**; see the known-gaps table in
``README.md``.

    The area-weighted shell centroid: one pass over the faces plus two host readbacks.

    """
    Volume, centre of mass and inertia tensor: ten ``float64`` sums over the faces.

    The one row in this module that is **readback-bound rather than kernel-bound**, and deliberately
    so: all three returns are host-side values, so four device reductions are followed by four
    crossings that no amount of kernel work amortises. Compare it against ``centroid`` above, which
    pays two -- the gap is what the extra quantities cost, and it is nearly all latency.

    ``igl.moments`` returns the first moment un-normalised and the inertia already about the centre
    of mass; ``trimesh``'s ``mass_properties`` computes the same three from the same integrals on
    the host. Both are timed on the whole call, since neither exposes the integrals separately.

    **pyvista answers the volume alone**, so its row does strictly less: ``PolyData.volume`` is the
    same divergence integral over the faces with no centre of mass and no inertia tensor, one
    readback rather than four. Unlike open3d's it does *not* validate first, which is what makes it
    safe to time here at all.

    There is no open3d row, measured rather than assumed: ``get_volume`` validates before it
    integrates, and the validation is the same brute-force ``IsWatertight`` composition its
    ``is_watertight`` row times -- seconds, on a mesh whose integral is microseconds. A row here
    would re-time ``is_watertight`` under this group's name (the same trap the validation module
    documents for ``is_volume``), and it raises outright on the non-watertight sweep meshes.

    The lesson the group is kept for: **a plausible cost model is not a measurement.** "Readback-
    bound" was true of this row and still hid a bytes-moved bug -- three ``.numpy().sum(axis=0)``
    reductions over the per-face ``vec3d`` integrands, 72 bytes per face rather than per return --
    for as long as nobody checked which of the two the number was. A caller wanting only the volume
    should still call [`volume`][triwarp.measures.volume], which pays one crossing.
