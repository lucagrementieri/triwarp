"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.reduce``.

This is the module every other one is built on, so what matters is the *floor*: a whole-array
reduction of a few hundred thousand elements is far too small to saturate a modern GPU, so these
numbers are dominated by launch latency and — for the reductions returning a Python scalar — by the
readback that ends them. That readback is why the full-array variants cannot be much faster than
they are, and why callers inside iterative loops keep values on device instead (the ``check_every``
discussion in ``triwarp/linalg.py``).

Three shapes are timed:

* **Tiled full-array reductions** (``sum``, ``mean``, ``minmax``) — a block reduction into an atomic
  accumulator, then one readback. ``minmax`` produces both extrema in one pass, so timing it next to
  a bare ``min`` is what justifies its existence.
* **Axis reductions** (``sum(axis=0)``, ``max(axis=1)``) — no readback: the result stays on device.
  These measure the kernel itself, uncontaminated by the host sync, and the row/column split shows
  the coalescing difference. The two are *not* the same kernel: ``max(axis=1)`` on an ``(n, 3)``
  table reduces a 3-wide extent and takes the one-thread-per-row serial path where ``sum(axis=0)``
  stays tiled. Timing both directions is what pins that dispatch.
* **Sort-based** (``median``) — the outlier: it radix-sorts a *copy* and reads the middle element,
  so it is O(n log n) and allocates where everything else here is one O(n) pass.

``vec3`` overloads are timed alongside the scalar ones because they are what real callers hit
(centroids, normal averages) and they exercise a different tile accumulator.

Inputs derive from the registry meshes so the sizes track the rest of the suite, and are built once
per (mesh, device) so the timed region holds only the reduction.

References
----------
``reduce`` is an array primitive, so the natural reference is **NumPy**: every group also times the
equivalent host reduction over an already-resident float32 buffer. Read those rows as the host-side
floor, not a like-for-like kernel race — a device reduction returning a Python scalar pays a flat
launch-plus-readback latency NumPy never pays, so NumPy *should* win at small sizes and the question
each row answers is where the crossover sits and whether the device side stays flat past it.
trimesh, libigl and open3d expose no array-reduction API.

**The split is by return type, not by size or dtype.** The groups handing back a device array or a
``wp.vec3`` (both axis groups, both ``vec3`` groups) are ahead of NumPy at every mesh — narrowly at
the smallest, where a single outlier round can invert a *mean* while the min and median stay ahead,
so read the min — and by two orders of magnitude at ``lucy``. The groups handing back a *Python
scalar* lose below roughly half a million elements and win above it.

That crossover is a host cost, measured rather than assumed: launch marshalling, the 4-byte readback
and the output allocation are tens of microseconds before a single element is touched, and only the
``sync`` term scales with ``n``. So a scalar-returning reduction cannot win at small ``n`` whatever
the kernel does.

Three kernel defects were found by asking the question these rows invite — whether the tiling is
earning its keep — and all are fixed. None was *exposed* by the NumPy rows, since triwarp was
already ahead in those groups. Two are the same bug in different clothes:

- **Tiling below one tile is pure loss.** With the reduced extent under ``TILE_1D`` the
  ``wp.tile_load`` branch is never reached and every lane of every block redundantly walks the same
  short row. One thread per output row is an order of magnitude faster on a tall narrow table. The
  converse holds — the same table on ``axis=0`` has three outputs, where serial is worse by as much
  — so the dispatch key is the **reduced extent**, not the axis.
- **The same thing one rank up.** A rank-2 ``axis=None`` reduction tiles ``TILE_2D`` squares, which
  an ``(n, 3)`` vertex or ``(m, 2)`` edge table clips exactly as above. Flattening a contiguous
  narrow table to the 1-D kernel is several times faster, and flat on a genuinely wide table where
  the tile branch does fire — which is why the test is on the trailing extent, not just contiguity.
- **One atomic per tile does not scale.** One ``atomic_add`` per tile puts hundreds of thousands of
  blocks on a single accumulator address; folding ``TILES_PER_BLOCK_1D`` tiles into a register first
  lands within a small factor of bandwidth.

Those are kernel-time A/Bs, interleaved under one clock state with values verified each round. End
to end the picture is uneven and worth reading carefully: the large-mesh cells of the axis and
rank-2 groups gain as much as the kernel A/B predicts, but every scalar-returning group at
feature-mesh scale moves by less than the cross-session drift band (CLAUDE.md section 15.7), so
those cells attribute nothing either way. That is the expected shape — tens of microseconds of such
a call was never the kernel, so no kernel change can move it.

One cross-check is worth keeping, because it says the rank-2 fix closed the gap rather than moved
time around: subtract the host floor and the rank-2 and rank-1 paths now agree on throughput per
element, where before the fix rank-2 was several times worse.

**pymeshlab** is the one exception and lands in ``median``.
``get_scalar_statistics_per_vertex`` reduces a per-vertex scalar to ``{min, max, avg, med, stddev,
variance}`` over the same input (seeded from ``z`` with ``compute_scalar_by_function_per_vertex``,
which reproduces ``_scalars_wp`` exactly). It answers six questions in one call, so its number is an
*upper* bound for any one of them and a *lower* bound for all of them; it appears once, in
``median``, because the percentile is the part that needs a sort and so dominates both sides. It is
read-only, so the MeshSet is shared and only the attribute seeding sits outside the timed callable.

The NumPy rows are the only ones *always* comparable: every group computes exactly the reduction its
NumPy call computes, so each pair is a class-A parity claim in
[`tests/test_reduce.py`](../tests/test_reduce.py) with no transform in between.
