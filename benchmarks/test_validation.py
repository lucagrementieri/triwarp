"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.validation``: the topological predicates.

Three axes, one per predicate family, because these functions fail to scale for three unrelated
reasons and a face-count sweep separates none of them.

* **valence** for ``is_vertex_manifold``: it solves a miniature connected-components problem in
  every vertex's one-ring, so its cost is the valence *distribution*, not the vertex count.
* **diameter** for ``face_orientation_bits``, the group that justified the axis. *Propagating* the
  Z2 bits across the face-adjacency graph costs one launch per level, so a long strip is O(V) rounds
  where a blob is O(log V) — two orders of magnitude apart at identical vertex count, with the
  direction reversing against trimesh, and entirely invisible to the scan registry, whose meshes are
  all compact blobs. The bits are *solved* instead, by a parity-carrying union-find in three
  launches, flat across the axis. The axis is kept because that flatness must not regress.
* **overlap** for ``is_watertight`` / ``is_volume``: both compose an edge-count test with a
  self-intersection test over a BVH, so what matters is collision density, not size.

References
----------
**open3d** is the exact definitional equivalent for ``is_watertight`` — triwarp's docstring defines
itself against ``TriangleMesh.is_watertight`` (edge-manifold without boundary, plus vertex-manifold
and no self-intersection). It is also **seconds** per call, three to four orders of magnitude
behind, and *faster on the harder mesh*, because its self-intersection test is a brute-force scan
that early-exits on the first hit and so pays full price only when the mesh is clean. Both points
are worth having on the record, so open3d runs here at ``rounds=1`` rather than being dropped; that
group is a large share of the suite's wall clock and is the reason for the cap.

**libigl**'s ``is_vertex_manifold`` is the reference for the valence group, and it is flat and safe
on ``fan_hub`` — unlike ``igl.principal_curvature``, which takes minutes on the same mesh (see
[`test_curvature.py`](test_curvature.py)).

open3d also covers both manifoldness groups: ``is_edge_manifold`` shares triwarp's
``allow_boundary_edges`` switch with identical semantics on both settings, and
``is_vertex_manifold`` agrees everywhere except vertices sitting *on* a non-manifold edge — open3d
tests whether the incident faces are edge-connected at all, triwarp and igl whether they form a
manifold fan, so three faces sharing one edge pass open3d and fail the other two.

**trimesh** rebuilds its mesh inside the timed callable because it caches derived properties; note
its ``is_watertight`` is edge-manifold-only, so it is timing context rather than an equivalent
computation. It has no ``is_vertex_manifold`` in 5.0; ``tm.repair.fix_winding`` is the closest
analogue of the orientation propagation and is timed against it.

There is no open3d ``is_volume``: its closest composition (``is_watertight() and is_orientable()``)
short-circuits on the first check, so it would time ``is_watertight`` under a different name.

**pymeshlab** covers all three groups and answers watertightness in a way neither other reference
does: ``get_topological_measures`` returns boundary edges, component count, genus, two-manifoldness
and the non-manifold edge and vertex counts — **one call for every predicate this module exposes
plus the genus and the Euler characteristic** — so its row is simultaneously the reference for
``is_watertight`` and ``is_volume``, an *upper* bound for each alone.

It does *not* include the self-intersection test, which is half of triwarp's and open3d's
definition, so the honest composition is both calls together: ``get_topological_measures`` plus
``compute_selection_by_self_intersections_per_face``, timed as one callable. That is the useful
number, because open3d computes the *same* composition two orders of magnitude slower — so nearly
all of open3d's cost is its brute-force self-intersection scan, and nothing about the definition
requires it. Both pymeshlab rows are also **flat across the overlap axis in the same direction as
everything else**, if anything *faster* on the self-intersecting mesh, which is the third
independent confirmation that collision density is not what drives this predicate.

For the valence group, ``compute_selection_by_non_manifold_per_vertex`` is the direct equivalent of
``is_vertex_manifold`` and is flat across the valence axis, like triwarp and libigl, so all three
agree the valence distribution is not a hot spot. Both selection filters touch only the selected
bit, so they share the MeshSet; ``get_topological_measures`` is read-only.

``face_orientation_bits`` has no pymeshlab equivalent returning the *bits*:
``meshing_re_orient_faces_coherently`` applies them and is benchmarked in
[`test_repair.py`](test_repair.py) against ``make_winding_consistent``, which consumes them.

    the pair prices what the stronger predicate costs. A mesh can be edge-manifold and not

    The per-face self-intersection flags, which ``is_watertight`` reduces to a single bool.

    Timed separately from ``is_watertight`` because the two libraries compose the predicate
    differently: triwarp's ``is_watertight`` runs the manifold checks *first* and this pass only if
    they hold, and MeshLib's ``isClosed`` never runs it at all. So the composite group prices three
    clauses on one side and one on the other, and only this group prices the clause they share.

    meshlib's ``findSelfCollidingTrianglesBS`` returns the same per-face set from an AABB tree over
    the faces, multi-threaded -- read it against ``triwarp-cuda``. ``touchIsIntersection=False`` is
    the setting that matches triwarp and is passed explicitly; the tree is built lazily on first
    use, so the mesh is constructed outside the timed callable and the row prices the query.

    pymeshfix's ``select_intersecting_triangles`` returns the same set exactly, from a uniform grid
    broad phase rather than a tree, single-threaded. It is the one pymeshfix row in this file,
    because it is the one where the operation clears the 30 % share the load leaves -- the query and
    the load are about equal on both meshes. The load is inside the timed callable and cannot be
    moved out (a ``PyTMesh`` takes exactly one ``load_array``), so read this row as query-plus-load
    and halve it for the query alone. ``tris_per_cell`` is its broad-phase bucket size and was
    measured not to change the answer at any value probed.

    differences to read the rows through: open3d returns pairs, so its output is larger than a mask
