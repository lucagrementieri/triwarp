"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.points``.

The point cloud is a registry mesh's own vertices — deterministic, and it scales with the mesh. The
functions here fall into two groups:

* **Tiled reductions** — ``fit_line`` and ``fit_plane`` accumulate a 3x3 scatter matrix with
  ``outer_sum_chunk`` and finish with a single-thread ``wp.svd3``. Both end in a host readback of
  the resulting axis / normal, so the numbers include one synchronisation by construction.
* **Element-wise maps and sorts** — ``point_plane_distance`` and ``vector_angle`` are one
  ``wp.map`` each (the cheapest thing in this module, so they are the most sensitive to launch
  overhead), and ``radial_sort`` is a key kernel plus a radix sort.

``estimate_normals`` is timed twice, because the public function takes the neighbour table as an
*input*:

* ``estimate_normals`` — the PCA kernel alone, on a cached ``(n, k)`` table. This is the
  measurement to read for a change to the covariance / SVD kernel.
* ``estimate_normals_knn`` — [`query_bvh_nearest`][triwarp.neighbors.query_bvh_nearest] plus the
  kernel, which is the whole of what open3d's ``estimate_normals`` does (it builds a ``KDTreeFlann``
  internally on every call), so it is the only fair cross-library comparison.

References
----------
**trimesh** covers everything except normal estimation: ``trimesh.points.point_plane_distance``,
``trimesh.points.major_axis``, ``trimesh.points.plane_fit``, ``trimesh.points.radial_sort`` and
``trimesh.geometry.vector_angle`` are the exact functions triwarp's are ports of.

**open3d** is the reference for ``estimate_normals``: ``PointCloud.estimate_normals`` with
``KDTreeSearchParamKNN`` is the same k-nearest PCA estimator (its ``FastEigen3x3`` picks the
smallest-eigenvalue eigenvector, as triwarp's ``wp.svd3`` path does).

**pymeshlab** covers three: ``compute_normal_for_point_clouds(k=)`` is the same k-nearest PCA
estimator at the same ``k`` (and it exists for exactly this case -- a dataset with no faces -- so
its input is a *face-less* MeshSet); ``compute_matrix_by_fitting_to_plane`` is the ``fit_plane``
counterpart, reporting the fitted normal and the average fitting error. That one has a
precondition: it raises ``Cannot compute rotation: there is no selection`` unless something is
selected, so ``set_selection_all`` runs first, untimed -- it is how the filter is told "fit all the
points", not part of the fit. It also builds a rotation matrix onto a target plane, which triwarp
does not, so its row is an upper bound. Third, ``compute_selection_point_cloud_outliers`` is the
LoOP score behind ``outlier_probability``, at the same ``knearest``.

The outlier groups are timed the same way as ``estimate_normals_knn``: the neighbour table is an
*input* of triwarp's functions and is built inside the timed callable, because both references build
their own k-d tree per call and there would otherwise be nothing to compare. ``open3d`` covers the
statistical variant (``remove_statistical_outlier``) and the radius one (``remove_radius_outlier``),
both of which additionally *copy* the surviving points into a new cloud -- triwarp returns a mask,
so those rows are upper bounds.

Three groups have no triwarp-side neighbour table to hoist, because they take the cloud directly:
``radius_outlier_mask``, ``duplicate_point_mask`` and ``farthest_point_sample``. Medians on
``sphere_med`` (40 962 points, RTX 5090, CUDA against open3d's one core):

| group | triwarp | open3d | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| ``radius_outlier_mask`` at 2 / 4 mean edges | 0.233 / 0.361 ms | 14.6 / 19.2 ms | 63x / 53x |
| ``duplicate_point_mask`` | 1.40 ms | 6.18 ms | 4.4x (15x on ``sphere_large``) |
| ``farthest_point_sample`` at 64 / 1024 | 1.92 / 32.3 ms | 2.94 / 41.9 ms | 1.5x / 1.3x |

The last row is the one to read carefully: the greedy loop is ``Theta(count)`` launches over the
whole cloud, so at ``count = 1024`` its 32 ms is ~2 000 launches of marshalling and essentially no
kernel time. That is why it barely beats a serial C++ loop, and why the count -- not the mesh -- is
its axis. On ``sphere_small`` (2 562 points) every one of the three *loses*, by 4x to 10x, for the
same reason in miniature: the launch floor does not shrink with the cloud.

MeshLab has nothing for ``fit_line`` / ``major_axis``, ``point_plane_distance``, ``vector_angle`` or
``radial_sort``: those are array primitives rather than filters.

**libigl** has no equivalent for anything in this module — it is a mesh library, and its
point-cloud entry points (``igl.fit_plane`` does not exist in the Python bindings) are not exposed.

Caps
----
Both ``estimate_normals`` groups are capped at ``bunny``. The neighbour table is what costs: at
``k = 30`` triwarp's k-NN kernel is the dominant term (see
[`test_neighbors.py`](test_neighbors.py), which times that kernel on its own), and open3d's serial
``KDTreeFlann`` scales the same way.

``fit_line``'s **trimesh** case is capped at ``bunny`` as well, and for a different reason:
``trimesh.points.major_axis`` calls ``numpy.linalg.svd`` on the ``(n, 3)`` point matrix with the
default ``full_matrices=True``, so it materializes the full ``(n, n)`` left-singular matrix — 1.39
**TiB** for dragon's 437,645 points, which raises ``numpy._core._exceptions._ArrayMemoryError``. The
triwarp side never forms that matrix (it accumulates a 3x3 Gram matrix and calls ``wp.svd3`` on it),
so it runs the full registry. ``fit_plane`` needs no such cap — ``trimesh.points.plane_fit`` does
not take the full-matrices path.

Everything else in the module runs the full registry.

    Exact positional dedup: two ``unique_1d`` rounds over 64-bit keys, then a first-occurrence pass.

    open-addressing hash builds and two sorts of the unique values, so it is the row to read for a
    change to ``grouping``'s uniqueness machinery from the point-cloud side.

    open3d's ``remove_duplicated_points`` answers the same question with an
    ``unordered_map<Vector3d>`` on one core and copies the survivors out; the mask here is compared
    against its survivor list in ``tests/test_points.py``. A registry mesh has *no* duplicated
    vertices, so all three rows do their full work and none takes an early exit.

    meshlib's ``findSmallestCloseVertices(cloud, 0.0)`` is the third implementation and the only
    multi-threaded one: it returns each point's smallest-indexed coincident neighbour, which is
    this mask under ``map != index`` (``tests/test_points.py``). It goes through the cloud's point
    tree rather than a hash, so unlike the other two rows its cost is a *search* -- which is why
    the tree is dropped per round the way the ``nearest_neighbor_distance`` row drops it, rather
    than being reused across rounds and pricing the query alone.

    meshlib's **7.43** and open3d's **30.0**, but at ``sphere_small`` triwarp is **1.47 ms** where
    both references are under 0.33 -- the two hash builds and two sorts have a fixed cost the
    reference searches do not, so this group's ratio *inverts* below a few thousand points. That is
    the shape to watch here rather than the large-cloud number.
