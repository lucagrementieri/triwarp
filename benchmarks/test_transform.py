"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.transform``: applying an affine matrix to a point buffer and to a mesh.

Axis: the **scan sweep**, and nothing else. An affine map is one fused-multiply-add chain per
element with no topology, no parameters and no data-dependent branching, so vertex count is the
whole story -- this is the purest bandwidth row in the suite and the one to read when a more
complicated row is suspected of being memory-bound.

The rows exist for a second reason, which is that they are the **floor** every cached-mesh
workflow is measured against. [`Trimesh.transform`][triwarp.mesh.Trimesh.transform] carries most
of its cache through a rigid motion, so what it costs is this row plus a BVH rebuild; a claim that
the cache is worth having is a claim about the *difference* between that and reassembling the
operators, and neither half means anything without this one.

No group here sweeps the transform *class*. Classification is a handful of host float comparisons
on a 4x4 -- [`classify_transform`][triwarp.transform.classify_transform] does no device work at
all -- so a rigid matrix and a shear cost the same to apply, and a row per class would measure the
same kernel five times. The class decides what is *recomputed afterwards*, which belongs to the
caller's workflow rather than to this call.

References
----------
**trimesh**'s ``transformations.transform_points`` is the closest match in the suite: a pure
function, arrays in and arrays out, with no mesh object involved. It is also ``float64`` against
triwarp's ``float32``, so it moves twice the bytes -- on a bandwidth row that is most of any gap
and the ratio should be read against it.

**pyvista**'s ``DataSet.transform(matrix, inplace=False)`` is VTK's ``vtkTransformFilter``. It
returns a new dataset and therefore also *copies the topology*, which triwarp's row does not, so
read it as an upper bound. Its default ``transform_all_input_vectors=False`` is left alone: with it
on, VTK would additionally push every normal and vector array through the inverse transpose, which
is [`transform_normals`][triwarp.transform.transform_normals]'s job and not this group's.

**open3d**'s ``PointCloud.transform`` **mutates**, so the cloud is rebuilt inside the timed
callable and the row prices that construction along with the transform -- the same rule its
``remove_*`` rows follow. On this operation the construction is the larger half at every size, so
the row is an upper bound with a wide margin rather than a close comparison.

**libigl** binds no transform: the C++ examples apply a matrix with Eigen directly, which would
make an igl row a NumPy row under another name. **meshlib**'s ``Mesh.transform`` mutates and needs
a fresh mesh per round like open3d's, and its ``AffineXf3f`` has to be assembled per call from
``Matrix3f`` rows; both are priced in ``new_mesh_ml`` rather than in the transform, so it is left
out rather than reported as a slow transform.
