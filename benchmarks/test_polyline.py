"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.polyline``.

The module has 27 public functions over one data shape — an ordered ``(n,)`` array of ``wp.vec3`` —
falling into four cost classes. One representative of each is timed rather than all 27, because
within a class the kernels differ only in the per-segment expression:

* **Whole-polyline reductions** (``polyline_length``, ``polyline_centroid``, ``polyline_normal``,
  ``polyline_radius``) — one pass into a scalar, launch-latency bound at these sizes.
  ``polyline_radius`` is the dearest: it projects every segment onto a plane and finds each
  segment's closest point before reducing.
* **Per-vertex maps** (``polyline_angles``, ``cumulative_arc_length``) — one purely local value per
  vertex.
* **Resampling** (``polyline_upsample`` / ``resample`` / ``downsample``) — a data-dependent output
  length, so a scan plus a host readback of the size before the write pass.
* **Simplification** (``polyline_simplify``) — Ramer-Douglas-Peucker evaluated
  **level-synchronously**: one round of four ``dim=n`` launches per level of the split tree, driven
  by ``wp.capture_while`` so no round costs a readback. The cost is the tree's *depth*, about
  ``log2(n)`` on a boundary loop. Warp cannot express the recursion but can express its **levels**,
  and the two accept the same points, because breadth-first and depth-first evaluation of one split
  tree differ only in order — worth nearly two orders of magnitude on the longest rim against a
  single-thread stack kernel. Its Notes carry the rows that lose and why the depth is bounded by
  the accepted count.

``polyline_point_distance`` is timed separately as the only function whose cost is a product of two
sizes (query points x segments).

``triangulate_polygon`` is the module's worked example of a cost that is not where it looks. It
delegates to a **parallel** multi-round ear clipper: a round clips a whole *independent set* of
ears, so what is serial is the **round count**. Up to ``EAR_ONE_BLOCK_MAX`` corners the whole round
loop is **one block** that runs every round itself, which trades the recording and replay of a
conditional graph -- flat in ``n``, and most of a small ring's call -- for three block barriers a
round; past it a round is four ``dim=n`` launches in a ``wp.capture_while`` loop. The 2D ring is
clipped as given: there is no plane fit, and the ring length, orientation and reflex count arrive
in one readback, so a small ring's residual is that readback, the face count and one launch.

The round *count* is what this group caught first: ranking competing ear candidates by raw ring
index lets ear ``i - 2`` suppress ear ``i`` on an alternating star, so exactly **one** ear is
clipped per round and the loop runs to its ``n`` cap. ``select_independent`` ranks by a bijective
hash instead — the textbook maximal-independent-set rule — and retires a constant fraction per
round.

Axis: **polyline**, a loop-length sweep rather than a face-count one, since nothing here reads a
face. Polylines are mesh *boundary loops*; the scan meshes are excluded because they are near-closed
surfaces whose holes are a handful of vertices each, so they would measure launch latency alone. The
longest loop of each mesh is gathered into a dense buffer once per (mesh, device) and reused, so the
timed region holds only the polyline function.

Two groups carry a second sweep on the parameter that drives them: ``polyline_simplify`` on its
tolerance (which sets the tree depth and so the round count) and ``polyline_point_distance`` on the
query count.

References
----------
**meshlib and pyvista are the baselines** and between them cover every group except the two
per-vertex maps. MeshLib's ``Polyline3`` is a complete polyline library; VTK reaches the same
operations through a single-cell ``PolyData``. Two hazards decide every row:

* **The single line cell.** ``pv.lines_from_points`` gives one two-point cell *per segment*, and
  every polyline filter then restarts at each — ``compute_arc_length`` reports orders of magnitude
  short and ``decimate_polyline`` is a **no-op at every reduction**. ``_polyline_pv`` builds one
  cell for that reason; a row built the other way times the right filter on the wrong input and
  reads as a suspiciously fast reference.
* **``pack()`` is mandatory after a decimation, and skipping it is silent.** ``vertsDeleted``
  reports the deletions while ``points.size()`` is unchanged and only ``topology.numValidVerts()``
  reflects them. ``totalLength()`` is already correct before packing, so a *length* comparison
  passes unpacked while a *point-count* one silently reads the input's count and reads as a no-op.
  CLAUDE.md section 7.6's ``getNumpyFaces``-without-``pack()`` rule, in a class it does not name.

Three groups stay triwarp-only, per function rather than blanket: **``polyline_radius``** (no
reference computes it — ``findCenterFromPoints`` is a centroid and ``findMaxProjectionOnPolyline``
is ``polyline_point_distance``'s question, which already carries its rows); **``polyline_angles``**
(MeshLib has ``edgeVector`` only, so a reference row would time a Python loop); and
``polyline_triangulate``, whose sibling ``triangulate_polygon`` carries trimesh while the clipper
itself carries meshlib and pyvista.

trimesh, libigl and open3d are unregistered, each for its own reason: trimesh models polylines as
``Path3D`` entities and its only simplification is a colinear-run merge; libigl's ``igl.upsample``
is *mesh* subdivision and its C++ ``ramer_douglas_peucker`` is not bound; and open3d's ``LineSet``
stores unordered segments with no ordering, length, resampling or simplification at all.

    Driving them by their own error parameter was rejected on a measurement.
    ``decimatePolyline``'s ``maxError`` is a collapse cost, **not** a deviation bound: on a random
    walk its output sits several times further from the input than the tolerance it was given, where
    triwarp's and pyvista's stay well inside it. So a tolerance-matched pair would be two different
    amounts of work under one parameter name.

    * **meshlib** ``decimatePolyline`` at ``maxDeletedVertices`` = triwarp's deletion count, with
      ``maxError`` opened up so the count is what binds. ``optimizeVertexPos`` is turned off for the
      reason the ``downsample`` row records; it mutates, so the ``Polyline3`` is rebuilt per round.
    * **pyvista** ``decimate_polyline`` takes a reduction *fraction*, handed the same count. It
      needs the **single-cell** ``PolyData`` ``_polyline_pv`` builds: on a ``lines_from_points``
      polyline (one two-point cell per segment) it is a no-op at every reduction, which is the
      silent-wrong-input hazard that builder exists for.

    product -- read the gap across the ``polyline`` axis rather than at one point. It has no
    batched form, so the row loops in Python and prices that loop along with the queries; the tree
    is built lazily and is pre-warmed outside the timed callable.

    pyvista's ``find_closest_cell`` is the same query through a ``vtkStaticCellLocator`` and,

    MeshLib one is a Python loop next to it. It reports the closest *point*, not the distance, so
    the row's output is one array wider than what it is timed against; the distance is a host
    subtraction and is left out deliberately.
