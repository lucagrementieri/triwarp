"""
Regenerate ``benchmarks/_known_slow_libraries.json`` from a full benchmark round's JSON output.

The full suite spends most of its wall clock on reference libraries, not on triwarp: measured, the
overwhelming majority of pytest-benchmark's own timed regions across the suite is reference-library
rows rather than triwarp's own. Most of that buys nothing -- a library that is already orders of
magnitude slower than triwarp on one cell does not become more informative by being timed again on
the next mesh size. ``benchmarks/conftest.py``'s
``bench_case`` / ``bench_lib`` fixtures skip a reference-library row outright when this table says
so, the same way ``skip_larger_than`` skips one by hand at a handful of call sites -- except this
table is generated rather than written by hand, because 668 sites is too many to place
individually.

**The policy, and why it is shaped this way.** A reference library is skipped for one exact
``(group, mesh_name, rest, library)`` cell when, in the source round's data:

1. it is **not** one of the two fastest entries overall for that cell (i.e. it is not triwarp
   itself and not the single fastest reference library) -- so every benchmarked cell always keeps
   at least one reference comparison, and
2. its own median exceeded ``--ratio`` (default 2.0) times triwarp-cuda's median.

This is deliberately **per-library, not per-cell**: a cell with three references where only the
third is a decisive loss keeps the other two. A stronger, per-*cell* policy -- if even the single
fastest reference already loses to triwarp by a wide margin, skip every reference for that cell
outright -- was measured to save a comparable amount, precisely because it also catches the
single-reference cells this per-library policy cannot touch, but it is not the default here: it was
still being evaluated, not adopted, when this table was cut. Re-run that analysis before raising
``--ratio`` past this one.

**Staleness.** This table is a snapshot, not a live measurement -- a future optimization could
flip a skipped cell back into a genuinely close race, and this script would not know until someone
reruns it. Regenerate after any full-suite round that ships a real win (a changed cotmatrix
assembly, a new BVH adoption, ...), the same discipline as re-probing a tuning constant after a
Warp upgrade (CLAUDE.md section 9). ``pytest --bench-all-libs`` ignores this table for one run
without needing to delete it -- use that before regenerating, so the new table is cut from a run
that saw every library.

Usage
-----
``uv run python benchmarks/regenerate_known_slow_libraries.py plans/benchmark-round-11-data/json``
    Rewrite ``benchmarks/_known_slow_libraries.json`` from a fresh round's ``--benchmark-json``
    output.
``uv run python benchmarks/regenerate_known_slow_libraries.py <json_dir> --ratio 2.0 --min-rank 3``
    Override the policy (defaults shown).
