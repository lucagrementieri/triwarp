"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.adjacency``: the face-pair table and the two quantities derived from it.

``face_adjacency`` is the package's most reused topological query and the widest composition in it:
an edge build, a row hash, a radix sort over ``3F`` keys, a scan-and-compact, and a gather. Two of
those steps read back to the host -- the compaction's output size, which is data-dependent and
unavoidable, and the hash radix, which is *not* when the caller knows the vertex count. That second
one is the ``n_vertices`` axis below: same answer, one less serialisation point, and the gap
between the two ids is what that keyword buys.

``face_adjacency_unshared`` and ``face_adjacency_angles`` are each one launch over an existing
adjacency table, so they are timed with the table precomputed. Timing them from raw faces would
just re-measure ``face_adjacency`` three times.

trimesh is the host reference for all three. Its ``Trimesh`` properties are cached, so each round
builds a fresh mesh; ``benchmarks/test_mesh.py`` covers the warm-cache side under
``mesh_face_adjacency`` and is deliberately a separate group.

**libigl** covers the first two groups with a single call: ``igl.triangle_triangle_adjacency``
returns ``(TT, TTi)``, the neighbour across each corner's edge and that edge's index in the
neighbour, which is triwarp's ``face_adjacency`` and ``face_adjacency_unshared`` in one pass and one
layout. Both rows therefore time the *same* igl call -- that is not double-counting, it is the
honest statement that igl does not separate them, and it makes ``face_adjacency_unshared``'s igl row
an upper bound rather than a like-for-like. ``face_adjacency_angles`` has no igl equivalent
(``igl.dihedral_angles`` is per-tet, on a tetrahedral mesh, not a surface).

    Manifold face pairs, with the hash radix inferred against supplied.

    ``inferred`` pays a ``reduce.minmax`` over the edge rows and the host readback that ends it;
    ``known_nv`` passes the vertex count instead and skips both. The answer is identical either
    way, so the whole gap is that one serialisation point -- if it does not show, the keyword is
    not worth threading through callers.

    ``igl.triangle_triangle_adjacency`` answers the same question in a **per-corner** layout: a
    ``(n_faces, 3)`` table whose entry ``[f, i]`` is the face across edge ``i`` of face ``f``, or
    ``-1``. That is a superset of triwarp's pair list -- every pair appears twice, once from each
    side -- so the row is a fair cost comparison and the parity assert carries the pair-extraction
    transform (``tests/test_adjacency.py``). Note the array form is the one to use: the
    ``triangle_triangle_adjacency_lists`` variant is the same computation returning
    ``list[list[int]]`` and costs 321 ms on ``bunny`` against 4.25 for this one, i.e. it would price
    nanobind rather than the algorithm.
