"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.intersection``.

Four functions on two different cost shapes:

* ``mesh_with_plane`` / ``slice_mesh_with_plane`` / ``clip_mesh_with_field`` — one pass over the
  faces, a per-vertex scalar, then a compaction of the (few) faces the level set actually crosses.
  Memory-bound and dominated by the full-mesh sweep, not by the segment count: a plane meets
  O(sqrt(n_faces)) triangles but every face is still classified. The last two run the *same* engine
  (the plane's signed distance is one such scalar), so their triwarp rows should track each other —
  measured 794 vs 859 µs on ``bunny`` — and a divergence means the shared path changed under one of
  them. ``clip_mesh_with_field``'s ``cap=True`` case is a different shape: the ``O(B^3)`` min-weight
  fill of the section loop dominates the clip by 60x (55 ms against 0.86 ms on ``bunny``), so read
  that case as a ``holes.fill_min_weight`` measurement on a long rim.
* ``mesh_with_mesh`` — the only quadratic-ish one. A ``wp.Mesh`` BVH is built over the smaller mesh
  and every triangle of the other supplies an AABB query, so the cost tracks the number of
  *candidate* pairs (capped per query triangle by ``max_triangle_collisions``) rather than the face
  count. This is the benchmark that moves when the separating-axis narrow phase changes.
* ``segments_with_plane`` — a pure ``wp.map`` over independent segments; the array-primitive
  baseline for the module.

References
----------
**trimesh** is the reference for three of the four: ``mesh_plane``, ``slice_faces_plane`` and
``plane_lines``. Its ``Trimesh`` is rebuilt inside the timed callable for ``mesh_plane`` because
``triangles`` / ``face_normals`` are cached properties that would make rounds 2..n measure only the
plane arithmetic. ``slice_faces_plane`` and ``plane_lines`` take raw arrays and need no rebuild.

**mesh_with_mesh has no *trimesh* or *open3d* reference.** trimesh's mesh-mesh intersection is not
in ``trimesh.intersections`` at all — it routes through the optional ``python-fcl`` collision
backend, which reports *whether* pairs collide rather than returning the intersection curve, and is
not a declared dependency. open3d's boolean operations require the (also optional) ``open3d.t``
tensor backend with a coupled remesh, so neither is an apples-to-apples baseline for "return the
intersection segments". The two that are: **meshlib**'s ``findIntersectionContours``, which links
the crossing into ordered contours, and **pyvista**'s ``intersection``
(``vtkIntersectionPolyDataFilter``), which returns the same unordered segment soup triwarp does and
therefore pins the value as well as the cost (36 = 36 segments and a bit-identical curve length in
``tests/test_intersection.py``).

**pymeshlab** has the right filter and cannot run it here. ``generate_polyline_from_planar_section``
does exactly what ``mesh_with_plane`` does and more (it *orders* the segments into a polyline), and
it works on the synthetic meshes -- but it raises ``PyMeshLabException: Failed to apply filter`` on
**every scan mesh**, at any ``planeaxis``, ``planeoffset`` or ``relativeto`` (probed on
``bunny_decimated`` with both ``'Z Axis'`` and ``'Custom Axis'``). That is the same non-manifold
boundary the libigl and potpourri3d references run into elsewhere in the suite, and this module's
groups are all on the scan sweep, so there is nowhere for the row to move. Recorded rather than
skipped, so it is not re-derived.

**libigl** has no plane-section or mesh-mesh intersection binding in the Python package, so it is
absent from the ``mesh_with_*`` and ``segments_with_plane`` groups. It *does* have the isocontour
operation, though -- an earlier version of this docstring claimed ``igl.ray_mesh_intersect`` was its
only intersection entry point, which was wrong: ``igl.isolines(V, F, S, vals)`` is precisely what
``marching_triangles`` computes, and it is a row in both of that function's groups.

**pyvista** (VTK 9.6) answers ``clip_mesh_with_field``'s uncapped case through
``PolyData.clip_scalar``, over the identical per-vertex field so the two do the same work.
``invert=False`` is passed explicitly: its default keeps the side *below* the value. Its capped
counterpart ``clip_closed_surface`` cannot be timed here at all — it validates the mesh first and
raises on any open edge, which every scan mesh has; the capped comparison therefore lives in
``tests/test_intersection.py`` on a closed synthetic mesh, and the capped benchmark case is
triwarp-only.

Caps
----
``mesh_with_mesh`` is capped at ``bunny``: the broad phase allocates
``max_triangle_collisions`` candidate slots per query triangle, so the pair buffer alone is
``16 * n_faces`` ints before the narrow phase filters it. ``clip_mesh_with_field``'s pyvista row is
capped there too, VTK's clip being a single-threaded per-cell sweep.

Geometry
--------
Every plane cuts through the middle of the mesh — the origin is the vertex-bounding-box centre and
the normal is a fixed off-axis direction — so the section is a full cross-section rather than a
near-miss that would exit early. ``mesh_with_mesh`` intersects the mesh with a copy of itself
translated by a fraction of its own extent, which guarantees a large, genuinely overlapping
intersection curve on every mesh.

    The same broad and narrow phase as ``mesh_with_mesh``, stopping before the segments.

    Read the two groups against each other: they share ``_colliding_face_pairs`` verbatim, so the
    gap is exactly what computing an intersection *segment* per crossing pair costs, plus the
    degenerate-segment filter. That is the reason this exists as its own group rather than being
    assumed cheaper.

    meshlib's ``findCollidingTriangleBitsets`` answers the same question and returns the two masks;
    it is the oracle in ``tests/test_intersection.py``, where the two agree face for face on a
    sphere-versus-box pair. pyvista's ``collision`` is a *contact* count rather than a crossing set
