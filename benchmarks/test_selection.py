"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.selection``: submesh extraction and vertex-selection morphology.

Two axes, and neither is the face count:

* **hops**, for the morphology pair. ``expand_vertex_mask`` / ``shrink_vertex_mask`` run a host loop
  of one full edge pass per hop, so their cost is ``hops x |E|`` -- completely independent of how
  many vertices are actually selected. That makes them the cleanest pure-iteration-count group in
  the suite: the slope between 1 and 8 hops should be exactly 8, and anything else means the pass
  is not doing constant work per hop.
* **components**, for ``exclude_fully_selected_components``. It runs a connected-components pass and
  then an all-selected test per component, so it inherits the component-count sensitivity that
  [`test_combine.py`](test_combine.py) documents for ``split``.

``submesh_from_face_indices`` gets a ``unique_indices`` sweep instead. That flag skips a dedup sort
the caller can promise is unnecessary, and ``combine.split`` relies on the fast path -- so the gap
between the two rows is exactly what ``split`` saves per component, which is worth knowing given
that ``split``'s per-component host sequence is the package's largest single slowness path.

References
----------
**trimesh**'s ``Trimesh.submesh`` is the reference for the extraction group; it takes a sequence of
face-index groups and returns a list of meshes, so it is given a single group to match triwarp's
single submesh.

Neither trimesh nor open3d nor libigl has selection *morphology* -- growing or shrinking a mask
across the mesh graph. **pymeshlab** does, and is the only reference the morphology pair has:
``apply_selection_dilatation`` / ``apply_selection_erosion``, MeshLab's Dilate / Erode Selection.

Two differences to read the rows against, neither of them correctable:

- **It is face morphology, not vertex morphology.** MeshLab dilates the selected *face* set (via
  VCGlib's loose vertex-from-face / face-from-vertex pair), so seeding it needs
  ``compute_selection_by_condition_per_face`` and a vertex selection handed to it is simply cleared.
  triwarp grows a vertex mask over the unique-edge table. Same operation class, same asymptotic work
  -- one full pass over the elements per hop -- on a different element type.
- **One filter call is one hop**, so the reference is a host loop of ``hops`` calls, which is
  structurally what ``expand_vertex_mask``'s own per-hop launch loop does.

The MeshSet is *shared* here rather than rebuilt per round, which is the exception to the rule in
``BenchCase.new_meshset_pml``: these filters touch only the selected bit, and their cost does not
depend on how much is selected (measured flat over 120 consecutive dilatations carrying
``sphere_med`` from a fraction of a percent to most of the faces selected). Rebuilding instead would
put a MeshSet build an order of magnitude dearer than the filter on top of it and flatten the slope
this group exists to measure. Both reference slopes are linear in the hop count, confirming
independently that a hop is constant work; triwarp is an order of magnitude ahead throughout.

trimesh's ``graph.connected_component_labels`` could reproduce
``exclude_fully_selected_components`` in several steps, but not as one call, so that group remains a
before/after self-comparison.

    Three references, and all three do the same two things triwarp does -- gather the faces and

    """
    The reverse of the group above: a seam back into the region it bounds.

    A flood fill on the dual graph blocked by the contour, so the cost is a face-adjacency pass plus
    a connected-component labelling -- both independent of the contour's length, which is why the
    contour is built once outside the timed callable on both sides.

    meshlib's ``fillContourLeft`` is the reference and agrees with this **exactly**, mask for mask
    and with the same convention for which side is "left"
    (tests/test_selection.py::test_faces_left_of_contour_matches_meshlib). Its input is a vector of
    directed ``EdgeId`` rather than an ``(k, 2)`` array; that vector is assembled outside the timed
    callable too, since it is a Python loop over ``findEdge`` and would otherwise be the row.

    An order of magnitude behind meshlib on a mesh with a short contour. Two things about that.

    It is **not** a like-for-like: meshlib is handed a ``MeshTopology`` built outside its row and
    floods from the seeds with a serial BFS, while triwarp builds the halfedge structure inside its
    row and labels *every* component before gathering. ``connected_component_labels_from_edges`` is
    most of the call once ``twins`` is supplied: the labelling is the algorithm, and the way to beat
    it would be a device-side frontier BFS, which this package has measured as a loss.

    The dual graph, the blocking test and the seeding are one pass over ``twins`` rather than a
    ``face_adjacency`` call plus a key sort over every halfedge plus a mask-compact over every dual
    edge -- a real win, and less than the stage timings projected, which is the usual direction for
    a projection built by subtraction.
