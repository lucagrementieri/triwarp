Benchmarks for ``triwarp.tangent_space``: frames, polar angles and transport.

Three groups over two axes:

* **valence** (``sphere_med`` -> ``fan_hub``, ``V`` and ``F`` pinned) for
  ``halfedge_tangent_angles``, which walks each vertex's ring twice in one thread -- once to total
  the corner angles, once to lay them out. It inherits ``vertex_one_rings``'s exposure to a single
  wide hub, and this is where that shows.
* **scale** for the frames and the transport angles, which are per-vertex and per-halfedge
  arithmetic with no walk in them.

Measured on an RTX 5090: ``halfedge_tangent_angles`` goes **615 us -> 19.4 ms, a 31.6x spread**, on
the valence axis -- more exposed than ``vertex_one_rings``'s 9.9x on the same two meshes, because
it walks the ring twice (once to total the corner angles, once to lay them out) and the hub's walk
is serial both times. ``vertex_tangent_frames`` runs 765 / 727 / 984 us over the scale axis against
potpourri3d's 2.70 / 63.1 / 373 ms, and ``halfedge_transport_angles`` 28 / 27 / 31 us, flat: given
the polar angles it is one read per halfedge and nothing else.

potpourri3d is the reference, but note what its row includes: its tangent frames are a by-product of
constructing ``MeshVectorHeatSolver``, which also builds the halfedge mesh, the cotangent Laplacian
and the connection Laplacian, and factors them. There is no way to ask it for the frames alone. So
its number is an **upper bound** on the frame cost, and a fair number only for the question "what
does it cost to get to the point of having tangent frames". ``use_intrinsic_delaunay=False`` keeps
its discretization the same as triwarp's.

That same construction is the only route to its connection Laplacian, which is what
``halfedge_transport_angles`` corresponds to (triwarp will assemble that matrix itself in a later
phase); until then the transport-angle row is triwarp-only, with potpourri3d's construction cost
shown in the frames group rather than double-counted here.

**trimesh**, **libigl** and **open3d** have no tangent-space machinery at all: none exposes a
per-vertex 2D basis, a rotational halfedge order or a connection. libigl's ``igl.local_basis`` is
per-*face* (a frame per triangle, from its own edge vectors) and needs no ring walk or intrinsic
flattening, so it answers a different question and is not comparable.

    A frame per face: one edge normalize and one cross product, plus the face normals.

    Read it against ``vertex_tangent_frames`` above, which is the same idea one dimension up and an
    order of magnitude more work: a vertex frame needs the angle-weighted normal and the one-ring
    walk that picks its reference halfedge, where a face frame needs only the face's own first edge.
    That contrast is the reason both exist -- and why this one is not gauge-dependent.

    ``igl.local_basis`` uses the identical convention (first edge, then ``normal x basis_x``), so
    unlike every other row in this module the two sides are element-wise comparable rather than
    comparable up to a rotation; ``tests/test_tangent_space.py`` asserts exactly that.
