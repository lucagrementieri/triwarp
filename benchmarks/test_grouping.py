"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.grouping``: fixed-multiplicity grouping and row deduplication.

``group`` runs the ``face_adjacency`` workload on the scan sweep -- interior edges appear exactly
twice, so ``length=2`` groups are the adjacent face pairs, and the cost is one radix sort over
``3F`` keys plus a segment pass.

``unique_rows`` instead sweeps the **duplicate density** at a fixed input length, because that is
the only thing that can move: the sort is oblivious to how many rows collide, so the density only
changes the size of the output compaction. A gap wider than the output-size ratio would mean the
segment scan is not oblivious, which is the thing worth catching.

There is no open3d equivalent for either: grouping and deduplicating rows of an arbitrary id array
is an array primitive, not a mesh operation, and open3d exposes nothing at that level. **trimesh
covers both**: ``grouping.unique_rows`` for the second and ``grouping.group(values, min_len,
max_len)`` for the first, which is the same operation reached by an ``argsort`` plus a NumPy segment
walk. Both reference branches are capped at ``bunny`` and are handed a host-built input, since a
benchmark input must not come from the code under test.

    Orientation-agnostic face deduplication: sort each row, then dedup.

    The axis is the duplicate density, as in ``unique_rows`` above: at ``half`` the input carries a
    *flipped* copy of half its faces, which is the case that separates an orientation-agnostic dedup
    from a plain row dedup -- the flipped copies must collapse.

    ``igl.unique_simplices`` is the same operation and returns ``(FF, IA, IC)`` where ``IC`` is
    triwarp's inverse. One difference to know before comparing: **igl returns the sorted rows**
    (``FF == sort(F(IA, :), 2)``) where triwarp returns the first occurrence with its original
    winding intact, so the parity comparison sorts triwarp's rows first.

    ``Trimesh.unique_faces`` is the third implementation and the one that makes this group's axis
    legible: it is a *mask* rather than a rebuild, so it does strictly less than the other two rows
    and it carries the property that separates this group from ``unique_rows`` -- it is
    orientation-agnostic, measured 320 kept from 340 where 20 are flipped copies. It is a cached
    property on a fresh
    ``Trimesh``, so the mesh is rebuilt inside the timed callable; that build is why the row is
    capped where igl's is.

    All three asserts bound the survivor count rather than pinning it to the input's, because two
    registry meshes carry duplicate faces of their own -- ``bunny_decimated`` has **87** (16 214
    unique of 16 301) and ``lucy`` likewise -- so a ``== n_faces`` assert was failing on them for
    every library, which is what a bound rather than an equality is for on a *shape* check.
