"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.voxels``.

Every group here is really a race between **one hash table and one NanoVDB grid**. open3d keeps a
``std::unordered_map<Eigen::Vector3i>`` and walks it on one core; triwarp keeps a NanoVDB index grid
whose build deduplicates as it goes and whose membership query is an ``O(1)`` probe from a kernel.
So the interesting reading is not any single row but the *slope*: how each side responds to the
cubic axis when the cell shrinks.

References
----------
**open3d** is the direct counterpart for four of the groups and computes the same answer in each:
``create_from_triangle_mesh_within_bounds`` runs Moller's tri-box test per candidate cell (in
``float64``, over a slightly wider candidate window that cannot change the accept set),
``create_from_point_cloud`` bins with the same ``min_bound - voxel_size / 2`` anchor,
``voxel_down_sample`` averages the same cells, and ``check_if_included`` answers the same membership
question. All four are asserted element-wise in ``tests/test_voxels.py``.

**trimesh** covers the morphology and the box meshing. ``voxel.morphology.binary_dilation`` and
``fill_cavities`` are ``scipy.ndimage`` on a dense array, so those two rows are really "sparse grid
against dense ndimage" and their axis is the one that separates them: the dense side pays for the
whole bounding box, the sparse side only for the occupied cells. ``voxel.ops.multibox`` builds
``12 n`` triangles on the host with no corner sharing.

**meshlib** adds the second dense implementation of the dilation, and the only multi-threaded one:
``expandVoxelsMask`` walks the same bounding box on every core, over a ``VoxelBitSet`` rather than a
NumPy array. It shares trimesh's input verbatim, so the ``dilate`` group reads as one sparse GPU
grid against two dense CPU passes over the identical occupancy. Its bitset **mutates**, so the row
rebuilds it every round -- through ``pedantic``'s untimed ``setup`` rather than inside the timed
callable, the one row in the suite that needs the distinction -- the load costs more than the
dilation it precedes, so folding it in would report the load (``BenchLibrary.run`` says why).

**libigl** covers the two lattice functions, ``grid`` and ``unique_sparse_voxel_corners``. Both are
single-core C++ over the same integer arithmetic, so they read as a bandwidth comparison.

``trimesh.voxel.creation.voxelize_subdivide`` is timed on the ``voxelize_mesh`` axis but is
**not** a parity reference — it is a different algorithm (subdivide every triangle until its edges
are under half a pitch, then round each vertex to a cell), and its result neither contains nor is
contained in the exact accept set. open3d is the oracle for that group.

What has no group, and why
--------------------------
``from_cells``, ``grid_transform``, ``cell_indices``, ``cell_centers``,
``occupancy_at_cells``, ``erode``, ``surface_voxels``, ``to_dense``, ``from_dense`` and
``to_field`` are each one launch over the voxel set with no allocation of their
own, so a row would time the wrapper floor rather than the operation. Most are covered anyway
through a group that calls them: ``fill_cavities`` and ``fill_orthographic`` both go through
``to_dense`` (and ``fill_orthographic`` through ``from_dense``, whose candidate pass
``fill_cavities`` fuses into its own last kernel), and ``surface_voxels`` runs the same probe kernel
as ``erode``.

``cells`` is the exception, because for ``order="sorted"`` the wrapper floor *is* the operation at
every size -- flat over three orders of magnitude of voxel counts -- so "the row would time the
floor" is a reason to keep the row rather than to drop it. That is what caught the two host
readbacks the bound stage used to make.

``surface_voxels`` has no reference row either: ``trimesh.voxel.morphology.surface`` exists, but it
is the ``erode`` complement on a dense array and would measure the same thing the ``dilate`` row
already does.

``closing`` and ``opening`` are ``dilate`` and ``erode`` composed in the two orders, so their rows
would be the sum of two rows that already exist. ``union`` / ``intersection`` / ``difference`` and
``revoxelize`` have no row for the reference half rather than the triwarp half: MeshLib answers the
set algebra as a bitwise fold over a dense ``VoxelBitSet``, so a ratio against a sparse rebuild
reports the fixture's density, and trimesh's ``ops.boolean_sparse`` needs the optional ``sparse``
package, which is not a dependency here. ``revoxelize`` is one occupancy probe per new cell over a
dense lattice that ``to_dense`` / ``from_dense`` already carry the cost of. All four declare the
omission with ``pytest.mark.parity(..., benchmarked=False)`` in ``tests/test_voxels.py``.
