"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.creation``: parametric primitive generation.

The only benchmarks in the suite with **no input mesh**, so they use the ``bench_lib`` fixture
rather than ``bench_case`` — see the mesh-free path in ``conftest.pytest_generate_tests``. Their
axis is **resolution**: ``sections`` for the revolution primitives, ``subdivisions`` for the
icosphere, ``face_count`` for the per-triangle generators, all as a plain
``pytest.mark.parametrize`` because there is no mesh for ``benchaxis`` to select. The largest
points give the device real work while staying inside the scale where ``revolve``'s absolute
degenerate-triangle threshold is meaningful.

References
----------
**trimesh** is the direct port source, so it is apples-to-apples everywhere: identical profile,
section count and face template. The one structural difference is the clean-up — trimesh hashes
positions inside ``Trimesh(process=True)`` where triwarp derives the coincident vertices from the
profile — and that step is measured on both sides rather than factored out.

**open3d** covers four, with caveats that matter for reading the numbers: ``create_cylinder`` /
``create_cone`` take a ``split`` count subdividing the wall along its axis (``split=1`` matches);
``create_sphere`` is a *UV* sphere whose ``resolution`` is the latitude count with longitude
derived as twice it, so it pairs with ``uv_sphere`` and is given ``sections // 2``; and
``create_icosahedron`` is never subdivided, so ``icosphere`` has no open3d counterpart.
``extrude_polygon``'s counterpart is in the tensor API (``extrude_linear``), which walls an
*already triangulated* mesh, so its row is the walls alone with the cap fan built outside the timed
callable — and its faces must be ``Int32``/``Int64`` where ``RaycastingScene.add_triangles`` takes
``UInt32``. open3d builds these with per-vertex C++ loops, so it wins on launch latency at low
resolution and the high end is the intended comparison: loop-per-vertex against one launch per
buffer.

**pymeshlab** covers five and is the only reference for ``icosphere``: its
``create_sphere(subdiv=)`` is a subdivided icosahedron, so unlike open3d's it pairs with
``icosphere`` and closes that gap.
``create_torus`` / ``create_annulus`` / ``create_cone`` map directly onto the section counts, and
the annulus is the only annular factory outside trimesh. ``create_cube(size=)`` takes one scale
factor rather than three extents, so it builds a cube where the others build a box — twelve
triangles either way, which is all that group measures. Its three non-icosahedral Platonic solids
are where triwarp's constant tables came from and the only reference for them; **libigl** has
exactly one, ``igl.icosahedron()``, which is why ``platonic_solids`` carries an icosahedron case.
Those rows take no parameters on any side and so are pure fixed cost. ``create_sphere_cap`` takes
the full aperture in degrees where triwarp takes the polar half-angle in radians, so its ``angle``
is twice triwarp's and both generate the identical lattice. MeshLab's primitives are a fixed
catalogue rather than a profile-and-sweep toolkit, so there is no ``uv_sphere`` / ``revolve`` /
``capsule`` / ``sweep_polygon`` / ``truncated_prisms`` counterpart. Every ``create_*`` pushes a new
mesh onto the set, so each row builds a fresh ``ml.MeshSet`` inside the timed callable; an empty
set is cheap, so unlike the mesh-driven modules that build is not a meaningful share.

**pyvista** (VTK 9.6) is the reference for the four parametric-surface groups and nothing else here
— ``pv.Sphere`` / ``Cube`` / ``Icosphere`` come in their own frames and scales. ``pv.Parametric*``
evaluates the identical map but takes a different route to the mesh: a per-point C++ loop, then
``vtkCleanPolyData`` welding the raw lattice by *distance*, where triwarp identifies the seam
combinatorially and never allocates the duplicates. ``clean=True`` is passed explicitly on every
row because pyvista's own default differs per surface, and an unwelded surface is a different and
cheaper thing to time.

What the numbers say
--------------------
**triwarp is flat in resolution** — a revolution primitive is two launches over one buffer each, so
its cost is the host-side allocation and launch floor every triwarp wrapper shares. trimesh
therefore wins at a low section count and loses by orders of magnitude at a high one, and open3d's
tight C++ loops win outright at small sizes while falling behind above a few thousand sections.

The parametric-surface groups are flat for the same reason: every resolution they time sits above
``creation._PARAMETRIC_LATTICE_DEVICE_FROM``, where the device lattice's flat floor of launches and
readbacks beats the host build, which is quadratic in the resolution. ``icosphere`` generates its
connectivity in closed form, so it is ``subdivisions + 2`` launches and sits on the same floor.

``extrude_polygon`` only ever exercises the *convex* fast path (a single fan), which is why the ear
clipper is benchmarked directly on a non-convex star ring — the same reasoning that gives
``polyline_simplify`` its own group in [`test_polyline.py`](test_polyline.py). So this row does not
move with anything done to the ear loop: it is a floor row wearing a triangulator's name.

Deliberately not benchmarked
----------------------------
``box``, ``icosahedron`` and ``axis`` are constant tables, so they measure only the per-wrapper
floor — worth measuring exactly once, which ``test_box`` does. ``capsule`` and
``extrude_triangulation`` are the ``revolve`` and triangulation engines behind a different profile,
already covered by ``cylinder`` / ``uv_sphere`` and ``extrude_polygon``.
