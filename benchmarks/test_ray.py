"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.ray``: the three ray-cast entry points over the mesh BVH.

Axis: **depth**, the registry's name for the number of times a ray pierces the surface
(``sphere_med`` at 2 against ``shells_8``'s 8 concentric shells at 16). It is the axis that
separates the three groups from each other rather than merely scaling them:

- ``intersects_any`` may stop at the *first* hit, so it should be flat across the axis;
- ``intersects_first`` must find the *nearest* hit, so it cannot stop early and pays the descent;
- ``intersects_location`` does the same traversal and additionally compacts the hits, so it should
  track ``intersects_first`` plus a scan.

A group whose cost follows the crossing count when it should not is the finding here; so is one
that does not when it should.

This file exists because meshlib is the first reference in the suite with a batched ray query --
until it landed, every ray function was timed only indirectly through ``test_proximity.py``'s BVH
groups, which is what ``tests/api_conventions.py`` recorded as the reason ``triwarp/ray.py`` had no
benchmark file.

References
----------
**meshlib**'s ``multiRayMeshIntersect`` answers all three questions from one traversal of the mesh's
AABB tree, so the same call backs all three groups here and the only difference between the rows is
*which outputs are requested*. That is a real property of the reference rather than a shortcut, and
it is also the hazard: ``MultiRayMeshIntersectResult`` starts with every field ``None`` and the call
fills only the fields already holding a container, so a row that forgets to attach one is timing a
query that computes nothing and asserting on ``None``. Each row attaches exactly the outputs its
triwarp counterpart returns, which is what makes the three rows comparable to each other.

Its tree is built lazily and cached on the ``Mesh``, so the mesh is constructed and pre-warmed with
one throwaway query outside the timed callable -- the ``BenchCase.new_mesh_ml`` rule for a query
row, and the same thing triwarp's rows do by holding a ``wp.Mesh``. The ray cloud is likewise an
*input*: filling a ``std_vector_Vector3_float`` is a Python loop over 10 000 ``Vector3f``
constructions, comparable to the query itself, so it is cached per mesh.

**open3d**'s ``RaycastingScene`` is Embree, which makes these the closest thing in the suite to a
fair fight on ray casting -- and it has **one method per group**, not one method for all three.
Reading only ``cast_rays`` makes it look like one dense record serving all of them; it is five
methods:

- ``test_occlusions`` is a genuine **any-hit** traversal and answers nothing else, which is what
  ``intersects_any`` is for and what MeshLib's row is only an upper bound on
  (``closestIntersect`` stays on there);
- ``cast_rays`` returns ``t_hit`` and ``primitive_ids`` densely -- ``intersects_first``'s answer,
  with ``INVALID_ID`` where triwarp writes ``-1``;
- ``cast_rays`` again for ``intersects_location``, where the hit points are ``origin + t_hit *
  dir`` and triwarp compacts, so open3d's row is the lower bound of the same work exactly as
  MeshLib's is.

``count_intersections`` is a **fourth** question -- the crossing count, which is the axis this file
is built on -- and there is no row for it because triwarp exposes no crossing-count entry point.
``list_intersections`` is a fifth (every hit along every ray).

The scene is built and pre-warmed outside the timed callable, like the MeshLib tree and triwarp's
``wp.Mesh``, and the rays are uploaded as one ``float32`` ``(n, 6)`` tensor once per mesh -- also an
input. Note ``add_triangles`` accepts ``uint32`` faces where the vtkutils-backed filters elsewhere
in open3d demand ``Int32``/``Int64``; two conventions inside one API.

**trimesh** has all three functions (``ray.intersects_first`` / ``intersects_any`` /
``intersects_id``) and is deliberately absent: its pure-Python engine takes minutes on these
meshes, and ``tests/test_ray.py`` already holds it as the correctness oracle, which is the useful
half.
