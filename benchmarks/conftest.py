"""
Benchmark harness: mesh loading, CLI flags, parametrization and a GPU-safe timing fixture.

Run with ``uv run pytest benchmarks/`` (the default ``pytest`` run only collects ``tests/``).

The mesh registries themselves live in [`meshes.py`](meshes.py). There are two, because there are
two questions: the scan meshes sweep triangle count, and the synthetic *feature* meshes each
perturb one cost driver -- component count, boundary loop count or length, graph diameter,
triangle quality, vertex valence, ray depth, collision density -- while pinning the vertex and/or
face count to a shared control. A benchmark picks whichever is relevant:

- ``@pytest.mark.benchaxis("components")`` runs the named ``meshes.AXES`` comparison,
- ``@pytest.mark.benchmeshes("sphere_med", ...)`` names meshes directly for a one-off,
- neither runs the scan sweep, filtered by ``--size`` / ``--cpu-max-size``.

The rule the suite follows is **one group measures one axis, at 2-3 points**. A group that has no
mesh axis at all (``triwarp.creation``) takes ``bench_lib`` instead of ``bench_case`` and sizes its
work with a plain ``pytest.mark.parametrize``.

Flags
-----
``--device={auto,cpu,cuda,both}``
    Which ``triwarp`` targets to time. ``auto`` (default) uses cuda when CUDA is available,
    else falls back to cpu — ``triwarp-cpu`` is not timed alongside cuda by default. Pass
    ``cpu`` for cpu only or ``both`` to time both triwarp targets. The ``trimesh`` / ``igl`` /
    ``open3d`` / ``scipy`` / ``numpy`` / ``potpourri3d`` / ``pymeshlab`` / ``pyvista`` /
    ``meshlib`` / ``pymeshfix`` CPU baselines are always included, and
    ``pytorch3d-cuda`` whenever the installed pytorch3d carries a working CUDA extension --
    ``pytorch3d`` is the one reference with GPU kernels of its own, so it is *not* selected by
    ``--device``, which chooses among triwarp's targets.
``--size=<comma list | all>``
    Restrict meshes to these size categories (``small,medium,large,extralarge,huge``).
``--cpu-max-size=<category>``
    CPU-bound libraries (``triwarp-cpu``, ``trimesh``, ``igl``, ``open3d``, ``scipy``,
    ``numpy``, ``potpourri3d``, ``pymeshlab``, ``pyvista``, ``meshlib``, ``pymeshfix``) skip
    meshes larger than this unless the size was named explicitly in ``--size``. Default ``large``
    — so
    ``happy_buddha`` and ``lucy`` run GPU-only by default while
    ``bunny_decimated``/``bunny``/``dragon`` run on CPU.
``--bench-all-libs``
    Run every reference library regardless of ``_known_slow_libraries.json``. Off by default: a
    library already measured losing to triwarp by more than 2x, and ranking 3rd-or-worse overall
    for that exact cell, is skipped rather than re-timed (``skip_known_slow``, below). Reference
    rows dominate the suite's timed regions and a library already far slower does not become more
    informative on the next mesh size. Pass this flag before regenerating the table with
    ``benchmarks/regenerate_known_slow_libraries.py``, so the new table is cut from a run that saw
    every library.

# ``cpu_bound`` marks references that only ever run on the CPU (the baselines), so the harness can
# skip them on the largest meshes by default. ``open3d`` is marked CPU-bound even though the
# installed wheel is a CUDA build: the legacy ``open3d.pipelines`` / ``open3d.geometry`` APIs the
# baselines use are CPU-only (only the newer ``open3d.t`` tensor API has GPU kernels).
#
# ``scipy`` is a narrow baseline -- only a *geometry* reference for the k-NN queries
# (``spatial.KDTree``). Every benchmark carries an explicit ``benchlibs`` marker, so it generates
# cases only where a branch exists.
#
# ``potpourri3d`` (geometry-central) is CPU-only and the only reference for the heat-method family.
# Its solver objects cache their factorizations, so a benchmark must construct the solver *inside*
# the timed callable to measure the work triwarp does per call.
#
# ``pymeshlab`` (MeshLab / VCGlib) is CPU-only and the broadest reference here. Two things shape
# every row: almost every filter *mutates* ``current_mesh()`` in place, and building the ``MeshSet``
# is a real per-vertex cost. So the MeshSet is built inside the timed callable via
# ``BenchCase.new_meshset_pml`` unless the filter is verified pure, and any row cheaper than the
# build cost is reporting the build. See ``BenchCase.new_meshset_pml`` for the full rule.
#
# ``pyvista`` (VTK) is CPU-only and single-threaded, and it wraps the **same VTK as vedo** -- so a
# group carries one of the two, never both, or the ratio compares a library against itself. Nothing
# is cached (repeat calls recompute in full, so one ``PolyData`` may be shared across the pure
# family), almost everything returns a *new* object and leaves its input alone (``inplace=False`` is
# the default; ``edge_mask`` is the one exception, writing ``point_ind`` into the input), and the
# build is cheap enough that ``mesh_pv`` is a shared cached property.
#
# ``meshlib`` (MeshLib's C++ core) is CPU-bound but, uniquely here, **multi-threaded**, where
# trimesh / igl / pymeshlab / pyvista are all effectively single-threaded. So a ``triwarp-cuda`` vs
# ``meshlib`` ratio is a fair fight in a way the other CPU ratios are not, and the other edge of the
# same knife is that a ``triwarp-cpu`` row loses to it on any parallel op regardless of algorithm.
# ``meshlib.mrcudapy`` is deliberately **not** used -- the plain ``mrmeshpy`` free functions are the
# reference, and a CUDA module would make the row incomparable with the others. Almost all of those
# mutate their ``Mesh`` in place, so the accessor is ``BenchCase.new_mesh_ml()`` and there is no
# cached property.
#
# ``pymeshfix`` (MeshFix / the TMesh kernel) is CPU-only, single-threaded and the *narrowest deep*
# reference here: nine bound algorithms, all repair. One fact decides every row: **the load is a
# large and often dominant share of it.** ``load_array`` is not a load but a connectivity repair,
# and a ``PyTMesh`` accepts exactly one load and one mutating call (a second raises), so the build
# goes inside the timed callable via ``BenchCase.new_tmesh_pmf()``. So a row exists **only where the
# operation is a substantial share of the round** -- the intersection family and
# ``clean_from_arrays`` qualify; the hole-fill and component-removal rows carry
# ``pytest.mark.parity(..., benchmarked=False)`` with the share in the reason instead. Capped at
# ``bunny``.
#
# For the algorithms *not* timed, **a share is necessary and not sufficient.** ``fix_connectivity``
# clears the bar on cost and is the counter-example: most of a round doing provably nothing, since
# ``load_array`` already ran it, so a row would price a no-op. ``clean`` and
# ``strong_intersection_removal`` are real work whose *result* is not comparable with any single
# triwarp function. ``strong_degeneracy_removal`` is under the bar outright.
#
# ``numpy`` is the narrowest baseline of all: only a reference for the *array primitives*
# (``triwarp.reduce``), where a host reduction over an already-resident buffer is the honest CPU
# floor. Deliberately not a geometry reference -- every other CPU baseline is built on NumPy.
#
# ``pytorch3d`` is the **only** reference with CUDA kernels of its own, so it takes *two* rows the
# way triwarp does. The ``-cuda`` row is the point: the one GPU-against-GPU comparison in the suite,
# and not a foregone conclusion. pytorch3d's ``_C`` carries **no spatial structure on either
# device** -- no tree, no grid, just the pairwise loop -- so the ratio is a crossover rather than a
# constant: brute force with perfect coalescing beats a BVH descent while the problem still fits the
# device's bandwidth, and loses by orders of magnitude once the cloud is large. So the neighbour and
# chamfer groups need the point count as an *axis*; a one-size row reports whichever side of the
# crossover it landed on.
#
# **Half of that crossover is triwarp's, and the row must not be read as a statement about brute
# force.** pytorch3d is a clean quadratic; triwarp's ``query_nearest`` is **non-monotonic** over the
# same sweep at ``k >= 8``, so the honest reading of the small-cloud row is "triwarp is well off its
# own large-cloud cost here", not "pytorch3d is faster". Two qualifications: the effect **does not
# exist at k = 1**, so it must not be read onto the ``*_k1`` rows, and it is **hash-grid specific**
# -- the ``bvh`` backend is monotonic over the identical sweep. Mechanism: the grid's cell width
# *is* ``initial_radius``, and a row whose true k-th distance runs past
# ``_knn_widest_grid_radius(cell, n)`` abandons the walk for an exact linear scan of the cloud.
#
# **There is deliberately no ``pytorch3d-cpu`` row.** pytorch3d is registered for its CUDA kernels,
# and its host path is a reference implementation rather than a tuned one, so a ``-cpu`` row
# measures the same missing spatial index at Theta(N^2) and adds nothing the other CPU baselines do
# not say better. Its neighbour and chamfer rows scale as a clean quadratic, which extrapolates to
# unbounded rounds on a scan mesh -- and two such rows once cost two whole modules' JSON, because
# ``--benchmark-json`` is written at session end. Where the CUDA extension is missing the reference
# is simply absent: ``_pytorch3d_cuda_available`` gates it, and nothing falls back to the host.
#
# Two things every pytorch3d row has to do. **Synchronize torch's stream** -- ``BenchCase.run``
# does it on the ``pytorch3d`` kind, because ``wp.synchronize_device`` synchronizes *Warp's* stream
# and torch launches are asynchronous, so without it a ``-cuda`` row times the launch and not the
# kernel. And **state its measured share**, on the pymeshfix precedent: the per-round overhead is
# the batched ``[None]`` wrap plus the ``Meshes`` construction and its cached ``*_packed()``
# derivations, and on a ``-cuda`` row also the host-to-device copy.

        Time ``fn`` with pytest-benchmark, synchronising inside the timed region on CUDA.

        Warp launches are asynchronous, so ``wp.synchronize_device`` must sit inside the timed
        callable to capture real GPU compute; CPU targets/references skip it.

        ``rounds`` lowers the repeat count for the handful of groups whose single call runs into
        hundreds of milliseconds (the hole-filling DP, ``split`` on a thousand components, an
        isotropic remesh, a Poisson reconstruction). Ten rounds of those alone would dominate the
        suite's wall clock, and their spread is wide enough that the extra samples buy nothing.

        ``setup`` builds a **fresh input per round, outside the timed region**, and its return value
        is passed to ``fn`` as the single positional argument. Most references that mutate their
        input rebuild it *inside* the timed callable instead (``new_mesh_ml``, ``new_meshset_pml``),
        which is right when the build is a small fraction of the call -- and honest, since a caller
        pays it too. Use ``setup`` where it is not: the MeshLib dilation row's voxel-bitset load
        costs more than the dilation itself, so folding it in would report the load. ``pedantic``
        runs ``setup`` before every round including the warmup, and forbids it above
        ``iterations=1`` -- which is what every row here already uses.

        **The sync is per-library, not per-device.** ``wp.synchronize_device`` synchronizes *Warp's*
        stream and says nothing about torch's, so a ``pytorch3d-cuda`` row synchronized the Warp way
        would time the launch and not the kernel -- the same class of error as section 8's
        launch-device hazard, in that it does not raise and simply reports a number that is far too
        good. That row therefore calls ``torch.cuda.synchronize()`` instead.

        **And a ``pytorch3d-cuda`` row releases torch's cached blocks when it finishes**, outside
        the timed region. torch's ``CUDACachingAllocator`` reserves device memory and returns it
        only on ``torch.cuda.empty_cache()``, so a large row can leave nothing for the Warp
        allocator that runs next and every ``triwarp-cuda`` row after it in the module dies with it
        -- and because the failures are all triwarp's, the surviving cells *understate* the loss
        table. The release is per-row rather than per-module because the two allocators interleave
        at row granularity. It is also the *whole* fix: the largest pytorch3d rows run uncapped with
        it in place, so the size cap that was going to accompany it was dropped rather than shipped.

        **A ``pytorch3d`` row also opts out of torch's sparse-tensor invariant checks**, before the
        timed region. torch validates nothing by default and warns once per process that it is doing
        so, which is the only warning a benchmark run raises; opting out explicitly silences it
        while leaving the row timing exactly what it timed before. Out rather than in because the
        checks cost a few percent of a sparse construction and ``ops.laplacian`` / ``cot_laplacian``
        / ``norm_laplacian`` / ``mesh_laplacian_smoothing`` all build a COO tensor inside the call
        being timed -- so leaving them on would charge the reference for validation triwarp's row
        does not perform, in the one module (``test_laplacian``) whose whole point is a
        like-for-like race between two sparse assemblies. ``tests/conftest.py`` opts *in*, where
        there is no clock to bias and a malformed tensor should raise rather than segfault.

          idempotent -- ``apply_selection_dilatation`` grows the set every call -- but their cost is
          independent of how much is selected, because each one is a full pass over the face set
          (measured flat from under a percent of the faces to most of them). So a group may seed
          the selection once, outside the timed callable, and still read a clean per-call cost.

        Because the state persists, a group that *depends* on the selection (the heat-geodesic
        source set, say) must establish it itself rather than inherit what a previous group left.

        Everything else -- including every ``meshing_*``, ``apply_coord_*`` and ``generate_*``
        filter -- must call ``new_meshset_pml`` instead.

        ``fillHole``, ``decimateMesh``, ``remesh``, ``subdivideMesh``, ``fixMeshDegeneracies``,

          magnitude** between a mesh's first ``findProjection`` and its second.
          A query row should therefore build the mesh *outside* the timed callable and pre-warm it
          with one throwaway query, so the row times the query rather than the tree -- which is
          what triwarp's ``wp.Mesh``-in-hand rows already do with their BVH. A row that rebuilds per
          round is timing the build.
        - A mutating call **invalidates** that tree, so the two decisions are not independent.

        every one of its nine algorithms mutates in place and returns a status, a count or an array

        The consequence is that **every pymeshfix row prices the load**, and the load is not small:
        on a scan mesh it is comparable with the most expensive operation and far larger than the
        cheap ones. A row whose operation is a small share of that total reports the load and reads
