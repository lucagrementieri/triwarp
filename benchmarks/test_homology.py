Benchmarks for ``triwarp.homology``: a basis of non-contractible loops.

Axis: **genus**, which exists for this module and is used by nothing else. Every other mesh in
either registry is genus 0 -- the scan meshes are open surfaces and the feature meshes are spheres,
grids and tubes -- so until ``handles_1`` and ``handles_64`` landed there was nothing here to run
on at all, which is what ``tests/api_conventions.py`` recorded as the reason this file did not
exist. The pair holds the footprint, the tessellation scale and the face count fixed at ~90 000 and
varies only the number of handles, so a spread across the axis attributes to the genus.

What the axis separates is the two halves of the algorithm: building the spanning tree and its
cotree, against *tracing* one walk per generator. ``sphere_med`` at genus 0 is the floor -- the
trees with no loops to trace at all -- and ``handles_64`` is 128 traces on top of the same work.

triwarp leads meshlib at every genus, where it was level at genus 1 and behind at genus 64. The
fused rewrite is worth two to three times the previous implementation, and the ratio rises with the
genus because the tracing it replaced was the part that scaled: the loops were walked one at a time
in Python over a ``parents`` array read back in full, and they are now two launches and a scan.

**The axis still separates the two halves of the algorithm**, but they no longer separate in the
clock: the spread across a 64x genus range is small, so the decomposition dominates and the tracing
is a fraction of it. There is no longer a ``tree_cotree`` group to read this one against: the
decomposition stopped
being a public entry point when it stopped being reachable except through this function, and the
attribution it existed for is in ``triwarp/kernels/homology.py``'s module docstring.

----------
**meshlib** is the only library in the suite that computes a homology basis. potpourri3d does not
bind geometry-central's homology code and neither trimesh nor libigl has one, which is why
``tests/test_homology.py`` otherwise stands on invariants. Its ``eliminateTunnels`` -- the consumer
of this basis, benchmarked as ``remove_tunnels`` in ``benchmarks/test_repair.py`` -- is a no-op
on every input probed, so that group has no meshlib row even though this one does.
``detectBasisTunnels`` returns a vector
of ``EdgeId`` paths -- the same 2 * genus loops, though not the same ones, since a basis is not
unique (measured on a torus: 32 and 18 edges against MeshLib's 72 and 32).

It reads the mesh and allocates its own scratch, so one ``Mesh`` serves every round, and it takes a
``MeshPart``, which does not own the mesh it wraps -- hence the module-level cache rather than a
temporary.

    The full basis: spanning tree, cotree, then one loop trace per generator, in one call.

    The genus axis prices the tracing, the half that scales with it, and the spread over a 64x
    genus range is small: the trace is two launches and a scan rather than a Python walk per
    generator over a ``parents`` array read back in full, so the decomposition is the cost at every
    genus this axis reaches.
