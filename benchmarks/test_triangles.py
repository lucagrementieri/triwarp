"""
Benchmarks for ``triwarp.triangles``: per-face arithmetic, one triangle at a time.

Nothing here reads connectivity, so the scan sweep (pure ``N``) is the right axis throughout and
every reference is doing the same cross products. The whole-mesh reductions these feed -- the
centroid, the volume and the moments -- are timed in
[`test_measures.py`](test_measures.py), beside the module that owns them.

``face_normals_and_areas`` returns both quantities from one cross product, which is what its
consumers in the library want (the heat method, the gradient operators, area-weighted normals). The
references split them up: ``igl.doublearea`` and ``potpourri3d.face_areas`` return areas only, and
``trimesh.triangles.normals`` returns unit normals plus a validity mask. The reference rows
therefore do strictly less work than triwarp's — read this group as a floor for them rather than as
a fair race.

**pymeshlab** splits them the other way: ``compute_normal_per_face`` is normals only, so it belongs
with the other partial references above. It is geometry-preserving, so it shares the MeshSet.

**pyvista** (VTK 9.6) is the one reference that answers both halves, but in *two* filters --
``compute_normals`` for the unit cell normal and ``compute_cell_sizes`` for the area -- so its row
times both calls rather than half the work. It is the only reference here whose normals come back
``float32``; the areas are ``float64``.

``face_quality`` runs on the **quality** axis rather than the scan sweep: it is the quantity that
axis is *defined* by (``saddle`` and ``saddle_graded`` share connectivity and differ only in
triangle shape), so measuring it there says whether reading the measure costs anything once the
triangles get bad. It should not — every metric is branch-free arithmetic on three edge vectors —
and that flatness is the point of the row. ``compute_scalar_by_aspect_ratio_per_face`` is the exact
filter the four VCG metrics were ported from and is geometry-preserving, so it shares the MeshSet;
``igl`` needs two calls (``circumradius`` and ``inradius``) to build the same ratio.

    One cross product per face: the operator prologue every solver in the library pays.

    The meshlib row is ``computePerFaceNormals`` alone -- normals, not areas -- for the same reason

    Python loop over the face buffer, and that row would time the loop rather than MeshLib (see
    section 6). Both halves are still compared for correctness, in
    tests/test_triangles.py::test_per_face_quantities_match_meshlib. Pure, so the mesh is built once

    ratio between the two groups is that redundancy. It is the price of a crease-aware answer.

    Both crease cases are timed because they are different work: with no creases every rotation
    completes and the walk is the full valence, while a creased mesh cuts it short. The crease set
