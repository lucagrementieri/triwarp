"""
Benchmarks for the three heat-diffusion solvers of ``triwarp.heat``.

One module because they are one family and share the property this suite really measures: each is
two or three conjugate-gradient solves against a cotangent or connection Laplacian, so each is
sensitive to the *conditioning* of that operator in a way every factorizing reference is not.
**That is the module's whole subject**, and the ``quality`` axis is how it is measured — ``saddle``
against ``saddle_graded`` holds vertices, faces and connectivity fixed and only worsens the aspect
ratio, which no face-count registry can express. Bad aspect ratios and obtuse angles (which send
cotangent weights negative) inflate the condition number and so the iteration count directly, and
the finding recurs at ``heat_geodesic_conditioning``, at ``heat_signed_distance`` and at
``log_map``.

Geodesic distance
=================
Axes: **scale**, the clean size sweep across two orders of magnitude of faces, and **quality**.

The method (Crane et al.) is three stages, two of which are sparse solves and dominate: diffuse heat
from the sources for a short time ``t``, normalize the gradient into a unit field pointing away from
them, then integrate that field back with a Poisson solve. It runs in ``float64`` — the diffused
heat decays exponentially and underflows ``float32``, collapsing the far field — which on a consumer
GPU means the solves run at the device's much lower double-precision rate. Inherent to the method,
not a tuning choice.

``geodesic_ball`` is **not** here: it lives in ``triwarp.neighbors`` and is timed as
``query_geodesic_ball`` in [`test_proximity.py`](test_proximity.py).

Four references, three of them the same method a different way. **libigl**'s ``heat_geodesics``
runs on every mesh in both axes, making the quality axis a direct iterative-versus-direct
comparison; on a scan mesh ``heat_geodesics_precompute`` raises ``Precomputation failed`` because it
factors the cotangent and Poisson systems directly. **potpourri3d** (geometry-central) is
constructed with ``use_robust=False`` so all three sides discretize the same triangulation — its
default mollifies and flips to an intrinsic Delaunay triangulation first, which is more work and a
different operator — and it also ships **fast marching**, timed as its own group, which triwarp has
no equivalent of by design. **pymeshlab**'s
``compute_scalar_by_heat_geodesic_distance_from_selection_per_vertex`` states the two properties
this module is built around in its own documentation ("very sensitive to triangulation", "first run
takes longer as factorization has to be built"), so it is the only reference whose amortized row
needs no API gymnastics; sources go in as a vertex selection. It is the third independent
confirmation of the quality axis's point — dead flat across the pair, like the other two direct
solvers — and it ships a **second, unrelated** algorithm for the same task, a Dijkstra-style front
over the edge graph, timed in ``fast_marching_distance``. **trimesh** and **open3d** have no
geodesic distance of any kind.

All three libraries split this into mesh-dependent setup (assembly, and for the references a
factorization) and a per-source solve, and the ``heat_geodesic`` group reports both points:
``setup=full`` puts the setup **inside** the timed callable, which is what a caller computing one
field pays — timing a back-substitution against a full iterative solve would compare nothing — and
``setup=amortized`` hoists it out. On triwarp's side that is a real API path (``heat_operators`` fed
back through ``heat_geodesic(..., operators=...)``), not a benchmark-only shortcut. The other groups
report ``full`` only. A single source vertex throughout: the method's cost is essentially
independent of the number of sources, which change only the right-hand side.

Signed distance to curves
=========================
The axis is the **source curve**, not the mesh: the mesh sets the solve size (fixed at
``sphere_med``) while the curve sets how much of the surface the source touches. ``ring`` is one
vertex's one-ring — the smallest curve that is closed, edge-connected and separating — and ``band``
a full latitude band of them, hundreds of segments. That contrast asks whether the cost is in the
*source*, which scales with the curve, or in the three solves, which do not. **The solves** — the
longer curve is if anything *cheaper*, because a source spread over the surface converges in fewer
iterations than a point-like one, and the splat does not register.

The stages are a vector diffusion on the connection Laplacian (a ``2 x 2``-block CG), a
normalization, and a Poisson solve; ``zero_set`` makes that last one a *constrained* solve through
the machinery behind ``linalg.min_quad_with_fixed``, which is why both level-set modes are timed —
extracting the free-free block costs several times one unconstrained solve.

**potpourri3d** is the only reference (``MeshSignedHeatSolver``), constructed inside the timed
callable per this suite's convention, and it requires every curve segment to lie within one face,
which is why the curves here are edge paths. trimesh, libigl, open3d and scipy have no signed
distance *on a surface* at all — trimesh's ``proximity.signed_distance`` signs against a closed
volume, a different question already benchmarked in [`test_proximity.py`](test_proximity.py).

Vector transport, scalar extension and the log map
=================================================
Everything here is conjugate gradient, so **quality** is again the axis that matters; ``scale`` is
reported alongside for the assembly cost, and ``transport_tangent_vectors`` carries a
``setup=full`` / ``setup=amortized`` layer with the operators hoisted out on both sides.

The three cost different numbers of solves, which is most of what separates them: ``extend_scalar``
two scalar solves, ``transport_tangent_vectors`` one ``2 x 2``-block vector solve plus an
``extend_scalar``, and ``log_map`` a vector solve plus a full ``heat_geodesic`` plus a gradient
pass.

**The comparison against the reference flips sign between the two amortized rows** — triwarp far
ahead at ``full`` and behind at ``amortized`` — for the reason the ``heat_geodesic`` rows show: a
factorization is expensive once and cheap thereafter, conjugate gradient is neither. Transport
barely feels the quality axis where ``log_map`` feels it several times over, the difference being
the distance field the log map also solves; **``log_map`` is the module's real result**.

Two implementation notes this level cannot see. ``vector_heat_operators`` caches the vector system's
own Jacobi preconditioner, which is a real saving on the vector solve alone and diluted below noise
once the rest of the call is included — landed for consistency with ``heat_operators``, not for a
win visible here. And ``extend_scalar``'s two right-hand sides diffuse through the identical
operator, so they are one batched two-column solve rather than two independent CG calls, which
``transport_tangent_vectors`` inherits and ``log_map`` does not (it calls ``heat_geodesic``).

Assembly alone is measured as ``connection_laplacian`` in
[`test_laplacian.py`](test_laplacian.py), since the operator lives in ``triwarp.laplacian``.

**potpourri3d** is again the only reference, constructed inside the timed callable — which for
``MeshVectorHeatSolver`` means a halfedge mesh and factoring both Laplacians — with
``use_intrinsic_delaunay=False`` so the discretization matches. It cannot run on ``cave_cube`` at
all: its right-angle diagonals give zero cotangent weights and geometry-central's factorization
fails there, so no group uses that mesh. trimesh, libigl and open3d have no tangent-space machinery.

    The serial single-source geodesics, for scale against the heat solvers on the same meshes.

    triwarp deliberately has no equivalent -- fast marching advances a priority queue one vertex at
    a time and has no parallel formulation -- so it has no row here. It is here to price that
    decision: the non-PDE alternatives for the same task, on the same axis and the same meshes, so
    the numbers can be read next to the ``heat_geodesic`` table. This group therefore contributes no
    ``parity`` pairs by construction (see ``tests/parity.py``): "triwarp agrees" is not a statement
    about a row triwarp does not have.

    Four rows, four serial fronts: potpourri3d's fast marching solves the local Eikonal update per
    triangle, MeshLab's ``compute_scalar_by_geodesic_distance_from_given_point_per_vertex`` advances
    a Dijkstra-style front over the edge graph, **libigl's ``exact_geodesic``** propagates the MMP
    exact windows -- the only one that is exact rather than first-order -- and **meshlib's
    ``computeSurfaceDistances``** is a fourth Eikonal front, the only one of the four that is
    multi-threaded. Its accuracy is measured against triwarp's heat method and against the exact
    great-circle field in ``tests/test_heat_distance.py``, where it matches triwarp's own worst
    deviation, so this row is a like-for-like cost for a like-for-like answer.

    **igl is capped at ``sphere_small`` with ``rounds=1``, and the slope says why.** At one source
    with every vertex as a target it rises by well over an order of magnitude per 4x step, so the
    next mesh up is already impractical per round. Window propagation is the price of exactness, and
    that slope is the most useful thing this row records.

    Its call is also the one signature trap in the module: ``exact_geodesic(V, F, VS, FS, VT, FT)``
    needs **all six** arguments. A four-argument call binds ``vt`` to ``FS`` and returns an *empty
    array* rather than raising, so the two face arrays are passed explicitly empty.
