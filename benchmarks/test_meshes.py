"""
Invariant checks for the synthetic feature meshes in [`meshes.py`](meshes.py).

Not benchmarks -- these are the guard rails that keep the benchmarks *meaningful*. Every feature
mesh exists to perturb one property of the ``sphere_med`` control while pinning the others, and
a group's timing spread is only attributable if that pinning actually holds. A silent change in
``trimesh.creation`` (a different section count, a cap that stops being a fan, an icosphere that
starts merging vertices) would leave every benchmark still running and still green while quietly
comparing two meshes that differ in more than one way.

So the recorded ``MeshSpec`` counts are checked against the built geometry, the topology each
mesh is chosen for is asserted directly, and the cross-mesh pinning invariants -- equal ``F``
across the component axis, equal ``V`` across the diameter and valence axes, identical
connectivity across the quality axis -- are checked as their own tests.
